                                        <p>The order is: FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → ORDER BY. This matters because WHERE is evaluated before grouping (filters rows), while HAVING is evaluated after grouping (filters groups). WHERE happens before aggregates are calculated, HAVING happens after. This timing determines what each clause can access and filter on.</p>

Use HAVING instead, which runs after aggregates are calculated.</p>

                                        <p>The timing problem is that WHERE runs at Step 2 (after FROM), but aggregates are calculated at Step 4 (after GROUP BY). Timeline: FROM → WHERE (no aggregates yet) → GROUP BY → calculate aggregates → HAVING (aggregates exist) → SELECT. It's conceptually impossible to filter on something before it's calculated, like trying to grade students based on test scores before the test is given.</p>

Pattern: WHERE filters rows before grouping (reduces input data), then HAVING filters groups after aggregation (reduces output groups). This is like having two separate filters at different stages. Example: WHERE state = 'CA' (row filter) ... GROUP BY customer_id ... HAVING SUM(amount) &gt; 1000 (group filter).</p>

                                        <p>HAVING filters groups, not individual rows. After GROUP BY creates groups (like one per customer), HAVING decides which entire groups to keep or discard based on their aggregate values. Example: HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 10 removes entire customer groups (all their rows) if that customer has 10 or fewer orders. WHERE filters individual rows; HAVING filters entire groups of rows.</p>

At the point WHERE runs, groups don't exist yet and COUNT() hasn't been calculated. You're trying to filter on information that doesn't exist yet - it's conceptually impossible to filter on an aggregate value before that value has been computed. Use HAVING instead, which runs after aggregates are calculated.</p>
