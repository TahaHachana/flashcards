# What is the typical range of values for a short int on a 32-bit system?

---

The typical range of values for a `short int` on a 32-bit system is from -32768 to 32767. This is because a `short int` typically uses 16 bits to represent signed integers, which allows it to store values in the range of -2^15 to 2^15-1. The maximum value is one less than the minimum value because 0 is included in the range of positive values. The exact range of values for a `short int` can vary depending on the system and compiler, but this is the typical range for a 16-bit `short int` on a 32-bit system.
