# What keyword is used to define a short integer type in C?

---

The `short` keyword is used to define a short integer type in C. A `short` integer typically uses fewer bits than a standard `int` to represent values, which allows it to store a smaller range of values. The exact number of bits used by a `short` integer can vary depending on the system and compiler, but it is typically less than the 32 bits used by a standard `int`.
