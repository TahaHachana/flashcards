# Import With Alias

The `import` statement in Python allows you to import a module with an alias. This is useful when you want to refer to a module with a different name in your code.

---

```python
# Import the math module with an alias
import math as m

# Use a function from the math module using the alias
result = m.sqrt(16)
print(result)  # Output: 4.0
```
