# Logical Operators

Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements and return Boolean results (True or False). The primary logical operators are and, or, and not.

b = False

# Logical AND
print(a and b)  # Output: False

# Logical OR
print(a or b)  # Output: True

# Logical NOT
