# While Loop

Loops in Python are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

```python
# Initialize a counter
count = 0

# Loop while the counter is less than 5
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
