# Comparison Operators

Comparison operators in Python are used to compare two values and return a Boolean result (True or False). The primary comparison operators include ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=.

```python
a = 10
b = 3

# Equal to
print(a == b)  # Output: False

# Not equal to
print(a != b)  # Output: True

# Less than
print(a < b)  # Output: False

# Greater than
print(a > b)  # Output: True

# Less than or equal to
print(a <= b)  # Output: False

# Greater than or equal to
print(a >= b)  # Output: True
```
