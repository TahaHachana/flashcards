# Pass

The pass statement in Python is used as a placeholder in loops, functions, classes, or conditional statements. It does nothing and is used to ensure syntactical correctness when a statement is required but no action is needed.

```python
# Using pass in a for loop:
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        pass  # Placeholder for future code
    else:
        print(i)

# Using pass in a while loop:
count = 0
while count < 10:
    if count % 2 == 0:
        pass  # Placeholder for future code
    else:
        print(count)
    count += 1

# Using pass in a function:
def my_function():
    pass  # Placeholder for future code

# Using pass in a class:
class MyClass:
    pass  # Placeholder for future code
```
