# For Loop

Loops in Python are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. The for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects.

```python
# Loop through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Loop through a range of numbers
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
