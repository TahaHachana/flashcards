# Formatted String Literals (f-strings)

Python 3.6 introduced f-strings, which provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. They are prefixed with the letter `f` or `F` and are evaluated at runtime.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
# Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
```
