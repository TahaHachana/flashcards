# Using `str.format()`

`str.format()` is a built-in method that allows multiple substitutions and value formatting. This method lets us concatenate elements within a string through positional formatting.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))
# Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
```
