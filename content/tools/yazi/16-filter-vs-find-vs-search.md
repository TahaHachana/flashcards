## Filter vs Find vs Search

What's the difference between filter (`f`), find (`/`), and search (`s`) in Yazi?

---

- `f` - Filter files (show only matching files in current view)
- `/` and `?` - Find next/previous file, navigate with `n`/`N`
- `s` - Search files by name using ripgrep (more powerful search)
