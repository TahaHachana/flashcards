## Progressive Expansion with Alt O

What happens when you repeatedly press `Alt-o` starting from a small selection?

---

The selection progressively expands to larger parent nodes in the syntax tree. For example, starting from `arg1`, first `Alt-o` selects the arguments, second `Alt-o` selects the entire function call, and you continue expanding upward through larger structural units.
