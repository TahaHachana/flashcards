## Syntax Tree Structure Example

In `func(arg1, arg2, arg3)`, what is the hierarchical relationship between the nodes?

---

The `call` node is the root, with two children: `identifier` (func) and `arguments`. The `arguments` node has three children that are siblings: `arg1`, `arg2`, and `arg3` identifiers.
