## Replace Surround Characters Command

How do you replace surrounding characters in Helix?

---

`mr<char_to_replace><new_char>` - With cursor inside surrounded text, press `m` (modifier), `r` (replace), the current surrounding character, then the new character (e.g., `mr([` changes `(text)` to `[text]`).
