## Selection First vs Traditional

Compare traditional action → motion editing with Helix's selection → action model using a delete word example.

---

Traditional (Vim-style): `dw` (delete word - action first)
Helix (selection-first): `wd` (select word, then delete - selection first)
The Helix approach provides visual feedback before executing the action.
