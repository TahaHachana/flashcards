## Word Textobject

What is the difference between `w` and `W` textobjects?

---

`w` (word) follows standard word boundaries and stops at punctuation (e.g., "hello-world" is two words).
`W` (WORD) includes all non-whitespace characters without stopping at punctuation (e.g., "hello-world" is one WORD).
