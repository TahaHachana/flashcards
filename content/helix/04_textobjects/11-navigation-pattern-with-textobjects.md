## Navigation Pattern with Textobjects

What is the general pattern for navigating between textobjects in Helix?

---

Use `]` followed by the textobject key to move forward (next), or `[` followed by the textobject key to move backward (previous). For example: `]t` (next type), `[a` (previous argument).
