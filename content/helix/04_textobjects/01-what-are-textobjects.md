## What Are Textobjects

What are textobjects in Helix and what purpose do they serve?

---

Textobjects are a way to select, manipulate, and operate on pieces of text in a structured way. They allow you to refer to blocks of text based on their structure or purpose (like words, functions, paragraphs) rather than selecting character-by-character.
