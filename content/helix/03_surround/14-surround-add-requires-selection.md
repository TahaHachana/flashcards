## Surround Add Requires Selection

What is the difference between the add surround command and the replace/delete surround commands in terms of selection requirements?

---

Add surround (`ms`) requires you to select text first. Replace (`mr`) and delete (`md`) commands work based on cursor proximity and automatically find the closest surrounding characters without requiring selection.
