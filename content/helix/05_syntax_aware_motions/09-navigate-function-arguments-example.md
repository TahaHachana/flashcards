## Navigate Function Arguments Example

In `func(arg1, arg2, arg3)`, if you have `arg1` selected, what happens after pressing `Alt-n` twice?

---

First `Alt-n` moves to `arg2`, second `Alt-n` moves to `arg3`. These are sibling nodes in the syntax tree, so `Alt-n` navigates through them sequentially.
