## Definition of Unstructured Data

What is unstructured data and how does it differ from structured data?

---

Unstructured data is data that is not organized in a predefined manner to meet the standards for structured data. Key differences:
- Does not fit neatly into tables
- Has undefined fields
- Cannot be stored in traditional relational databases
- Stored in non-relational databases instead
- Must be stored in data lakes or large object storage
- There is far more unstructured data in the world than structured data
