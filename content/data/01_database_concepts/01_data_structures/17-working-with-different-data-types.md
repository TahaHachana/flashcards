## Working with Different Data Types

Why is it important for data analysts to understand all three data structure types (structured, unstructured, and semi-structured)?

---

Data analysts need to understand all three types because:
- All three types coexist in organizational systems
- Working with structured data and putting data into structure is part of everyday work
- Converting between types is often necessary for analysis
- Different storage solutions are required for each type
- Real-world data doesn't always fit neatly into one category
- Understanding data types enables better decision-making about storage, analysis, and transformation strategies
