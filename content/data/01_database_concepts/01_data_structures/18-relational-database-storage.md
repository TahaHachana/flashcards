## Relational Database Storage

What type of data can be stored in a relational database, and what type cannot?

---

Relational databases can store: Structured data
Relational databases cannot store: Unstructured data

Unstructured data must be stored in non-relational databases, data lakes, or large object storage systems. Semi-structured data may require special data types (BLOB, CLOB) even when stored in database systems.
