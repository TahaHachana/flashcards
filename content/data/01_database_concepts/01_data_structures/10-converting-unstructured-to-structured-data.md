## Converting Unstructured to Structured Data

Using the hiring process example, explain how unstructured data can be converted to structured data.

---

In the hiring process:
- Unstructured data: Handwritten applications, paper resumes, scanned PDFs
- These are scanned and stored as PDF files (still unstructured)
- A staff member creates a record in the Application Interview system
- Structured data is created by entering information into fields (first name, last name, contact info)
- The PDF resume can be attached to the structured record
- Result: Unstructured data is partially converted into structured data while maintaining the original source
