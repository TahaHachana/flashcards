## Social Media Analytics Example

In the social media analytics example, explain what data is structured versus unstructured and why this matters for companies.

---

Unstructured data: People's written reactions and comments to posts (would require manual reading)
Structured data: Number of likes/reactions (quantifiable metric)

This matters because companies can gauge potential product/service success based on reactions. The "like" feature converts unstructured opinions into structured, measurable data that's easier to analyze at scale.
