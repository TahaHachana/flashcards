## Metadata in Semi-Structured Data

What is metadata in the context of semi-structured data, and why is it important?

---

Metadata is structured information that is automatically added when images or other files are created and loaded into software and data systems. It is important because:
- Provides structured information about unstructured content
- Creates additional structured data points around unstructured data
- Enhances searchability and organization
- Acts as a bridge between unstructured content and structured systems
