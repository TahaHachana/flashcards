## Volume Comparison of Data Types

Which type of data (structured or unstructured) is more prevalent in the world, and why?

---

Unstructured data is far more prevalent in the world than structured data. This is because:
- Humans produce a huge volume of unstructured data daily
- Modern technology makes creating unstructured data (videos, images, documents) extremely easy
- Accessibility of creation tools has dramatically increased unstructured data production
- Unstructured data is "here to stay"
- There's ongoing effort to find ways to convert unstructured data into structured formats
