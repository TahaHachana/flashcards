## Practical Significance of Semi-Structured Data

Why is semi-structured data practically significant in modern data systems?

---

Semi-structured data is significant because:
- Enables systems to handle diverse data types within the same framework
- Provides flexibility while maintaining some organizational structure
- Facilitates the transformation of unstructured data into structured formats
- Common in modern applications that need to handle mixed data types
- Bridges the gap between rigid structured systems and completely unstructured content
- Allows organizations to work with real-world data that doesn't fit neatly into one category
