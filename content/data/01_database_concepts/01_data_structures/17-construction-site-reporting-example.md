## Construction Site Reporting Example

Using the construction site foreman example, explain how semi-structured data combines different data types.

---

In the construction site example, a foreman reports an issue by:
- Capturing a photograph of the problem (unstructured data)
- Typing a note describing the issue (structured data)
- Both are stored together in a single record based on system design

This creates semi-structured data because it combines unstructured content (the image) with structured content (the typed note) in one coherent record, demonstrating how real-world applications handle mixed data types.
