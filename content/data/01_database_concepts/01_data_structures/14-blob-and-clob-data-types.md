## BLOB and CLOB Data Types

What are BLOB and CLOB data types, and when are they used?

---

BLOB and CLOB are special data types used for semi-structured data:
- BLOB (Binary Large Object): Used for storing binary data
- CLOB (Character Large Object): Used for storing character data

These data types are required because semi-structured data does not meet the rigid standards of structured data and needs flexible storage solutions that can handle mixed or large objects.
