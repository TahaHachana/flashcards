## Converting Unstructured to Structured Data

How can unstructured data be converted into structured data, and why is this valuable?

---

Unstructured data can be converted to structured data by:
- Extracting specific information from unstructured sources
- Entering that information into defined fields in a database or system
- Maintaining the original unstructured source while creating structured records
- Adding metadata and tags to make unstructured data searchable

This is valuable because structured data is easier to search, analyze, and use for decision-making at scale.
