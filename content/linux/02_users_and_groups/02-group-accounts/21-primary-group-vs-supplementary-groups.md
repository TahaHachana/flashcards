## Primary Group vs Supplementary Groups

What is the difference between a primary group and supplementary groups?

---

Every user account has exactly ONE primary group, which is their default/initial login group (modified with lowercase `-g`). Users can be members of MANY supplementary groups, which are additional group memberships beyond the primary group (modified with uppercase `-G`).
