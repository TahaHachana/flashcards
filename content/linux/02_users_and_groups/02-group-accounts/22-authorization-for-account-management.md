## Authorization for Account Management

Who is authorized to create, modify, or remove user and group accounts?

---

Only the root user or anyone with delegated privileges via `sudo` can create, modify, or remove user and group accounts. If you cannot perform these operations, make sure you are using an account with proper authorization.
