## Bash Script Shebang Line

What is the shebang line in a Bash script and why is it important?

---

The shebang line is `#!/bin/bash` and it must be the first line of the script. It specifies the script interpreter (Bash) that should be used to execute the script. Without it, the system may not know how to interpret the script.
