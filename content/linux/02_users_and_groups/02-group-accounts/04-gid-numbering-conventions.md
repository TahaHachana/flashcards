## GID Numbering Conventions

What are the typical GID numbering conventions for standard groups versus system groups?

---

Standard user groups typically receive a GID of 1000 or higher when created. System groups usually begin their numbering with GID 101. Standard groups manage user access to resources, while system groups manage operating system functions. Note that specific GID ranges vary by distribution.
