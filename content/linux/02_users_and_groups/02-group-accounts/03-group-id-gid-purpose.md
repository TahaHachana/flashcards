## Group ID (GID) Purpose

What is a Group ID (GID) and why is it important?

---

A Group ID (GID) is a computer-readable unique identifier number assigned to each group (similar to how groups have human-readable names like "Sales"). The GID helps the Linux system track group membership efficiently. Each group must have a unique GID.
