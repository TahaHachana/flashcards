## Groups Definition and Purpose

What are groups in Linux and what is their primary purpose?

---

Groups are collections of user accounts that have similar security requirements. Their primary purpose is to serve as an administrative tool for controlling access to resources. It is more efficient to grant permissions to a single group with multiple members than to grant access to each user account individually.
