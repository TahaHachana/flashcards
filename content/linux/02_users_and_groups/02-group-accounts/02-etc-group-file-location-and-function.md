## /etc/group File Location and Function

Where does Linux store group information and what does this file contain?

Linux stores groups in a file named `/etc/group`. This file lists existing groups and any user accounts that are members of those groups. You can view the contents using commands like `tail /etc/group` to see the last 10 entries.
