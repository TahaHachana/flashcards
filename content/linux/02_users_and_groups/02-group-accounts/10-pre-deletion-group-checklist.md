## Pre-Deletion Group Checklist

What should you do before deleting a group?

---

Before deleting a group, you should:
1. Look for any files or resources linked to the group
2. Set up another group to have access to those resources
3. Only then delete the original group

This prevents orphaned resources and ensures continued access to important files.
