## Alternative Group Commands

What alternative commands do some Linux distributions use for group management?

---

Some Linux distributions use:
- `addgroup` instead of `groupadd`
- `delgroup` instead of `groupdel`

These alternatives are considered easier to use and can be added to systems that don't have them by default. Distribution-specific variations exist, so check which commands are available on your system.
