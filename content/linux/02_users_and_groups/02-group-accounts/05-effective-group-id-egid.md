## Effective Group ID (EGID)

What is an Effective Group ID (EGID) and what is its purpose?

---

Groups may have an Effective Group ID (EGID) tied to privilege escalation and the Set Group ID (SGID) special permission. The EGID group identity helps enable access to resources managed by another group if the administrator has configured the appropriate permissions. It facilitates dynamic group-based privilege escalation.
