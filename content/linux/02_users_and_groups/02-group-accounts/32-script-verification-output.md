## Script Verification Output

Why should account management scripts include verification output?

---

Scripts should include verification output to:
1. Display results after operations
2. Confirm successful execution
3. Help with troubleshooting
4. Provide immediate feedback

Example: Using `tail -n 3 /etc/passwd` and `tail -n 3 /etc/group` to show newly created users and groups, along with echo statements explaining what was done.
