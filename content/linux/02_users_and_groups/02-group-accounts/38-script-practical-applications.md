1. Lab environments - Quick setup for training sessions and consistent student environments
2. Classroom settings - Create accounts for entire class and assign students to project groups

4. Development systems - Initialize developer workstations and set up team collaboration groups

Scripts simplify repetitive tasks and ensure consistency across these environments.
