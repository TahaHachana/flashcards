## Script Comments Best Practice

Why should you use comments in account management scripts?

---

Comments (using #) should be used to:
1. Explain what each section of the script does
2. Make scripts maintainable
3. Help other administrators understand the code
4. Document the script's purpose and functionality
5. Facilitate troubleshooting and modifications

Good documentation is essential for script maintenance and team collaboration.
