## Three Benefits of Scripting

What are the three primary benefits of using scripts for repetitive user management tasks?

---

1. **Consistent Settings**: Script runs the same way every time. All accounts created with identical options. No variation between executions.

2. **Speed**: System processes script commands much faster than manual typing. Can create dozens of accounts in seconds instead of minutes/hours.

3. **Reduced Errors**: Script cannot make typographical errors (if the script itself is correct). Eliminates human mistakes like typos, forgotten options, or inconsistent settings.

**Additional Benefits**: Scalability (5 users or 500 users same effort), documentation (script serves as process documentation), maintainability (change once, affects all future runs).

**Key Principle**: Automation is critical for sysadmins. Script any task performed more than a few times.
