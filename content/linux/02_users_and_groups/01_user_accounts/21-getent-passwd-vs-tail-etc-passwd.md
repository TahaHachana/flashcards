## getent passwd vs tail /etc/passwd

Why is "getent passwd" preferred over "tail /etc/passwd" or "cat /etc/passwd" for viewing user information?

---

**getent passwd [username]**:
- Shows users from ALL sources (local AND network)
- Works with LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
- Works with other directory services
- Single command regardless of authentication backend
- Complete picture of all users on system
- **Preferred in enterprise environments**

**tail /etc/passwd** or **cat /etc/passwd**:
- Shows ONLY local users
- Does NOT show LDAP or network-authenticated users
- Incomplete view in directory service environments
- Direct file reading
- Works on simple, local-only systems

**Key Advantage**: getent works with multiple authentication backends, making it the better choice for verification, especially in LDAP environments.

**Usage**:
- `getent passwd` - all users
- `getent passwd username` - specific user
- `getent shadow username` - password info (requires root)
