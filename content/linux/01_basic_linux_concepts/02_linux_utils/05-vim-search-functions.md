## Vim Search Functions

How do you search for text in Vim, and how do you navigate between search results?

---

- `/word` - searches forward for "word"
- `?word` - searches backward for "word"
- `n` - jumps to next search match
- `N` - jumps to previous search match

All searches are initiated from Command mode.
