## Vim Insert Mode Indicator

How can you tell when Vim is in Insert mode, and how do you return to Command mode?

When in Insert mode, the word "INSERT" appears in the lower left corner of the screen. To return to Command mode, press the `ESC` key. This is essential before executing save or exit commands.
