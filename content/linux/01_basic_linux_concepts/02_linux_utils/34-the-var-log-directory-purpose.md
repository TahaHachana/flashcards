## The /var/log Directory Purpose

What is the purpose of `/var/log`, and why is it called "var"?

---

**Purpose:** Central location for system and application log files

**Why "var":**
- Stands for "variable"
- Contains files that change frequently
- Size grows over time as logs accumulate
- Dynamic content that varies during system operation

**Contents:**
- System logs (kernel messages, boot logs, system events)
- Application logs (web servers, databases, mail servers)
- Security logs (authentication attempts, access logs)
- Service logs (daemon-specific log files)
- Error logs (application and system errors)

Essential for troubleshooting, security monitoring, and system analysis.
