## Three Critical Directories Summary

Summarize the "rule of three" for Linux system administration directories: what type of information is found in each location?

---

1. **`/home/username`** - USER DATA
   - Personal files and settings
   - User-specific configurations
   - Private workspace for each user

2. **`/etc`** - CONFIGURATIONS
   - System-wide configuration files
   - Service settings
   - Security policies

3. **`/var/log`** - LOGS (the story)
   - System and application logs
   - Error messages
   - Security events

**Memory aid:** User data in `/home`, configurations in `/etc`, and the story of what happened in `/var/log`.
