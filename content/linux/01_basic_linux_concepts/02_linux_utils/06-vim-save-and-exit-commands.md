## Vim Save and Exit Commands

What are the different Vim commands for saving and exiting, and when would you use each?

---

- `:w` - save (write) changes only
- `:wq` or `:exit` - save changes and exit
- `:q` - quit without saving (only if no changes made)
- `:q!` - force quit without saving, discarding all changes

All commands require pressing `ESC` first to enter Command mode, then `:` to access Command-Line mode.
