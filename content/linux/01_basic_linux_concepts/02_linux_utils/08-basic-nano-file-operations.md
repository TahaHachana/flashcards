## Basic Nano File Operations

What are the essential nano commands for creating/opening, editing, saving, and closing files?

---

1. **Create/Open**: `nano {filename}` - creates new buffer or opens existing file
2. **Edit**: Just start typing; use arrow keys to move cursor
3. **Save**: `Ctrl+O` - Write Out (prompts for filename if new)
4. **Close**: `Ctrl+X` - exits nano (prompts to save if unsaved changes exist)
