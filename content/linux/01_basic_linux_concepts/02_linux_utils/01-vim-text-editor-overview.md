## Vim Text Editor Overview

What are the three operational modes in Vim, and what is the primary purpose of each mode?

1. **Command Mode** (default): Keyboard keys issue commands for navigation and text manipulation, not for inserting text
2. **Insert Mode**: Keyboard functions normally for text entry; accessed by pressing `i` from Command mode
3. **Execute Mode** (Command-Line Mode): Provides a command prompt accessed by typing `:` for saving, exiting, and advanced commands
