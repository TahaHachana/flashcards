## Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

What is the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), and why is it important for Linux administrators?

---

**FHS** is a standard that defines the directory structure and organization in Linux systems, maintained by the Linux Foundation.

**Why it's important:**
- **Consistency**: Provides uniformity across hundreds of distributions
- **Predictability**: Administrators know where to find specific resources
- **Portability**: Skills transfer seamlessly between distributions
- **Efficiency**: Reduces learning curve when switching systems
- **Documentation**: Standard locations simplify creating and following documentation

Allows administrators to work confidently on any Linux distribution without relearning directory structures.
