## The su Command Purpose

What does "su" stand for, and what is its primary purpose in Linux?

---

**su** stands for "Substitute User" (or "Switch User"). Its primary purpose is to allow users to switch from their current account to another user account (most commonly root) without logging out and back in. When no username is specified, `su` defaults to switching to the root account.
