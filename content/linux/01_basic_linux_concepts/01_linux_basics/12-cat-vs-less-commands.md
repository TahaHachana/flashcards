## cat vs less Commands

What is the difference between the cat and less commands?

---

cat displays the entire contents of a text file on the screen all at once. less displays file contents one screen at a time with pagination, allowing scrolling through large files that don't fit on one screen. less is useful for viewing large files without overwhelming the screen.
