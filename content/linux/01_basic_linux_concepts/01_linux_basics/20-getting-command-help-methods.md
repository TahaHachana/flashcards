## Getting Command Help Methods

What are the four methods for getting help with Linux commands, and when should each be used?

---

1. man pages - standard reference with good detail level
2. info - more extensive information with linked documentation
3. --help option - quick reminder of options, condensed format for users already familiar with the command
4. help command - built-in shell commands, fast summary

Syntax: `man {command}`, `info {command}`, `{command} --help`, `help {command}`
