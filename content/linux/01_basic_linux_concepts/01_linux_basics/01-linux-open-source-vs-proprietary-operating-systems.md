## Linux Open-Source vs Proprietary Operating Systems

What is the key difference between Linux and operating systems like Windows and macOS?

---

Linux is open-source, meaning its source code is freely available to anyone at no cost and can be modified by anyone. Windows and macOS are closed-source (proprietary), meaning they don't expose their programming code and don't allow anyone else to modify it.
