## whoami Command Use Case

Why is the whoami command important in Linux?

---

The whoami command displays the name of the current user. It's especially important because in Linux, it's common to switch between user accounts (e.g., between a regular user account and the root/superuser account). When switching back and forth, you might forget which user you're currently logged in as. whoami helps avoid confusion and potential mistakes.
