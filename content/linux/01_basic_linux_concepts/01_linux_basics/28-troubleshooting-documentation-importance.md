## Troubleshooting Documentation Importance

What should be documented during troubleshooting and when should documentation occur?

---

Document: symptoms of the problem, results of research, results of each step (successful or not), root cause identified, solution implemented, and verification results.

When: Throughout the ENTIRE troubleshooting process, not just at the end. Documentation is a best practice during each phase and helps others in the future, as well as "future you."
