## Linux GUI Options and Characteristics

How do Linux GUI options differ from Windows and macOS, and what are common Linux GUIs?

---

Unlike Windows and macOS (which provide one GUI), Linux users can install zero, one, or multiple GUI environments and switch between them. GUIs are distinguished by user-friendly interface and performance (processor time and memory consumption).

Common Linux GUIs: GNOME, KDE Plasma, Cinnamon, and MATE.
