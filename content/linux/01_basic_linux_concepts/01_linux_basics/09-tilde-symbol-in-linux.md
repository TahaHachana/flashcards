## Tilde Symbol in Linux

What does the tilde (~) symbol represent in Linux?

---

The tilde is a shortcut that points to the /home directory of the currently logged-in user. For example, if logged in as user "jpatrick", the tilde represents /home/jpatrick. It's commonly used with the cd command (e.g., cd ~) to return to the user's home directory.
