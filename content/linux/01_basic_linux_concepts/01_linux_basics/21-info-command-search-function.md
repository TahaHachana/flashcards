## Info Command Search Function

How do you search within an info page, and how does it differ from man pages?

---

In info pages, press Control + S (not forward slash like in man pages) to begin a search, then type the search term. Search results are highlighted. Navigate with arrow keys and Page Up/Down, and press Q to exit.
