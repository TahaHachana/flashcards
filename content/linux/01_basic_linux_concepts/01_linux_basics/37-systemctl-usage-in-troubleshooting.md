## systemctl Usage in Troubleshooting

How is the systemctl command used during troubleshooting?

systemctl is used to check the status of services. For example, if a service isn't running during troubleshooting, you can check its status with systemctl. This is part of testing theories during the troubleshooting process - a simple check that should be performed before more complex diagnostics.
