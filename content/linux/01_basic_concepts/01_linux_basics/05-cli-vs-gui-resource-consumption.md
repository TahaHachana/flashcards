## CLI vs GUI Resource Consumption

Why is GUI installation often discouraged on Linux servers?

---

GUIs consume significant hardware resources, specifically memory and processor time. On servers, these resources should be dedicated to the service provided (such as handling database queries or managing print jobs) rather than running a GUI. Desktop systems may need user-friendly GUIs, but servers typically do not.
