## Command Subcommand Syntax

Provide an example of command subcommand syntax using the ip command and explain the structure.

---

Structure: `command subcommand [argument]`

Examples:
- `ip addr` - displays all IP addresses for all interfaces
- `ip addr show eth0` - displays IP info for eth0 interface only
- `ip link help` - displays help about the ip link subcommand

In these examples, "addr", "link", and "help" are subcommands of the "ip" command.
