## Default Linux Shell

What is the default shell for most Linux distributions and what is its role?

---

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is the default shell for most Linux distributions. A shell is a software component that provides the command-line interface by accepting user input, processing it for syntax, and providing output back to the user. Bash is the only shell required for CompTIA Linux+ certification.
