## Bash Command Syntax Rules

What is the critical spacing rule in Bash command syntax?

---

There must be a SPACE between the three primary components: command, options, and arguments. For example: `ls -la /var/log` has spaces separating `ls` (command), `-la` (options), and `/var/log` (argument). Without proper spacing, Bash will generate an error.
