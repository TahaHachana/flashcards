## Two Major Linux Distribution Families

What are the two major Linux distribution families, and what is the primary difference between them?

---

The two major families are Red Hat Linux and Debian Linux. The primary difference is their software management approach: Red Hat-based distros use rpm, yum, and dnf commands, while Debian-based distros use dpkg, apt, and aptitude commands. They also package software differently.
