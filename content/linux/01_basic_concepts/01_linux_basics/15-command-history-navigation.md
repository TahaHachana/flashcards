## Command History Navigation

How do you navigate and use command history in Bash?

---

Use Up Arrow to recall the most recently used command, and Down Arrow to cycle forward through history. Press Enter when the desired command appears. You can also type `history` to display all commands with numbers, then use `!` followed by the command number to execute that specific command (e.g., `!15`).
