## Determining Problem Scope

What is the most important question when determining the scope of a problem?

---

Does the problem exist for one user or multiple users?

This helps determine if the problem is network-based (affecting multiple devices/locations) or software-based (possibly a misconfiguration). It's also important to back up data if there's any risk during troubleshooting.
