## Bash Syntax Components

What are the four primary components of Bash syntax?

---

1. Command - the primary instruction given to the system
2. Subcommand - a secondary, more detailed instruction supporting the primary command
3. Option - a command modifier that changes how the system processes a command
4. Argument - the object on which the command acts (e.g., filename to be deleted)
