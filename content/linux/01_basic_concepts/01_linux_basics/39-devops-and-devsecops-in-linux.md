## DevOps and DevSecOps in Linux

What are DevOps and DevSecOps in the context of Linux infrastructure?

---

DevOps is an approach to managing Linux servers and services that works toward high quality, iterative, and frequent updates and releases. DevSecOps extends this by integrating security throughout the design, implementation, and development lifecycle, rather than treating security as a separate concern.
