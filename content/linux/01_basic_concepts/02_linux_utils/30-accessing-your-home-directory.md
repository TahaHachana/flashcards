## Accessing Your Home Directory

What are three different ways to navigate to your own home directory in Linux?

---

1. **Tilde shortcut:** `cd ~`
2. **Environment variable:** `cd $HOME`
3. **Full path:** `cd /home/username`

All three methods accomplish the same goal. The tilde (`~`) is the quickest and most commonly used method. You can verify your current location with the `pwd` command after navigating.
