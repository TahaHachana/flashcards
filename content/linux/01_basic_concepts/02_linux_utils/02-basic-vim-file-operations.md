## Basic Vim File Operations

What are the four essential Vim commands for creating/opening, editing, saving, and closing files?

---

1. **Create/Open**: `vim {filename}` - creates new empty file or opens existing file
2. **Edit**: `i` - enters Insert mode to begin editing
3. **Save**: `ESC` then `:w` - exits Insert mode and writes changes to disk
4. **Close**: `ESC` then `:q` - exits Vim (or `:wq` to save and exit together)
