## Divide and Conquer Strategy

What is the divide and conquer algorithm design technique and how does it work?

---

Divide and conquer is an algorithm design strategy that works by:
1. Breaking a problem into smaller subproblems
2. Solving each subproblem independently
3. Combining the solutions to solve the original problem

Examples include merge sort and quick sort. This approach is particularly effective when subproblems are similar to the original problem but smaller in size.
