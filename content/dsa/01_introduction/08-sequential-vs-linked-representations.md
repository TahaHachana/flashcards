## Sequential vs Linked Representations

What is the difference between sequential and linked representations of linear data structures?

---

Sequential representation uses contiguous memory allocation where elements are stored in adjacent memory locations (examples: arrays, stacks using arrays, queues using arrays).

Linked representation uses nodes connected via pointers/references, where elements can be scattered in memory (examples: linked lists, linked stacks, linked queues).
