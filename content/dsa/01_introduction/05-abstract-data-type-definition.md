## Abstract Data Type Definition

What is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) and what two components does it consist of?

---

An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a mathematical model that consists of:
1. A set of data objects (the actual data)
2. A set of fundamental operations that can be performed on those objects

The ADT defines what operations are available, not how they are implemented. It separates the interface from the implementation details.
