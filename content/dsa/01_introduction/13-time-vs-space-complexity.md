## Time Complexity vs Space Complexity

What is the difference between time complexity and space complexity? Which is emphasized more in algorithm analysis?

---

**Time Complexity**: A function of the running time of an algorithm - seeks the fastest algorithm that completes in minimum time

**Space Complexity**: A function of the memory space needed by an algorithm to run to completion - seeks algorithms requiring limited memory

**Emphasis**: Time complexity is more commonly analyzed and emphasized in algorithm analysis, though both are important performance measures.
