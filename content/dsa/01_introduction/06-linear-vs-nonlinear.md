## Linear vs Nonlinear Data Structures

What distinguishes linear data structures from nonlinear data structures? Provide examples of each.

---

**Linear Data Structures**: Unidimensional, represent linear lists
- Sequential: Arrays, Stacks, Queues
- Linked: Linked Lists, Linked Stacks, Linked Queues

**Nonlinear Data Structures**: Two-dimensional representations
- Trees (hierarchical structure)
- Graphs (network structure with nodes and edges)
