## Five-Step Algorithm Structure

Every algorithm comprises five fundamental steps. Name them in order. (Mnemonic: I-A-D-R-O)

---

1. **Input Step**: Accept the initial data
2. **Assignment Step**: Set up variables and values for processing
3. **Decision Step**: Make logical decisions (branching)
4. **Repetitive Step**: Loop through operations as needed
5. **Output Step**: Generate and release results
