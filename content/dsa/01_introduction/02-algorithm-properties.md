## Five Essential Algorithm Properties

What are the five essential properties that define a valid algorithm? (Hint: FDGEI)

---

1. **Finiteness**: Must terminate after a finite number of steps
2. **Definiteness**: Steps must be precisely and unambiguously defined
3. **Generality**: Must solve all problems of a particular class
4. **Effectiveness**: Operations must be basic enough to execute with pencil and paper
5. **Input-Output**: Must have precise inputs and produce outputs (intermediate or final)
