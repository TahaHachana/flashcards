## Time Complexity vs Space Complexity

What is the difference between time complexity and space complexity in algorithm analysis?

---

Time complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm grows with input size (measured in terms of operations executed).

Space complexity measures how memory usage grows with input size (includes space for variables, call stack, and data structures).

Both are important for evaluating algorithm efficiency, though time complexity is typically the primary focus.
