## Algorithms as Verbs, Data Structures as Nouns

How do algorithms and data structures complement each other in problem-solving?

---

Algorithms and data structures work as complementary partners:
- Algorithms are the verbs (actions: search, sort, insert, delete)
- Data structures are the nouns (containers: arrays, trees, graphs)

Neither is complete without the other. An algorithm needs data structures to organize inputs and results, while data structures need algorithms to perform useful operations. The choice of data structure fundamentally affects which algorithms can be used efficiently.
