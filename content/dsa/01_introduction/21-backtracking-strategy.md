## Backtracking Strategy

What is backtracking as an algorithm design technique and when is it useful?

---

Backtracking is a technique that builds solutions incrementally and abandons paths (backtracks) when they fail to satisfy the problem constraints.

It explores the solution space systematically, trying possibilities and undoing choices that don't work. Backtracking is useful for constraint satisfaction problems and when the solution space can be represented as a tree. Examples include the N-Queens problem and Sudoku solvers.
