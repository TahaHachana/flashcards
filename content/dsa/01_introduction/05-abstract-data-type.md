## Abstract Data Type Definition

What is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) and what three components define it?

---

An ADT describes the data objects that constitute a data structure and the fundamental operations supported on them. It is defined by:
- **L** (domain): The domain over which the data is defined
- **D** (data objects): {x | x âˆˆ L}
- **O** (operations): The set of supported operations

ADTs promote data abstraction, focusing on WHAT a data structure does rather than HOW it does it, making them language and paradigm independent.
