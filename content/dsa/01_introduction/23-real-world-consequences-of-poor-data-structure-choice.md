## Real-World Consequences of Poor Data Structure Choice

What are some real-world consequences of choosing the wrong data structure in software systems?

---

Choosing the wrong data structure can lead to:
- Website crashes due to inability to handle high traffic
- Security vulnerabilities from poor data organization
- Wasted computational resources (CPU, memory, energy)
- Poor user experience from slow response times
- Financial losses for businesses where performance impacts revenue

Example: Social media platforms must use efficient data structures to handle billions of posts, or the service becomes unusably slow.
