1. **Machines**: Hardware requirements and configuration
2. **Languages**: Programming languages and software constraints
3. **Foundations**: Problem models, solution methods, performance measures (where algorithms and data structures reside)
4. **Technologies**: Implementation technologies (web, mobile, IoT, etc.)
