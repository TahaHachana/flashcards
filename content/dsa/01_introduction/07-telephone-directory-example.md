## Telephone Directory Data Structure Example

Why does the telephone directory example demonstrate the importance of data structure selection?

---

**Structured (alphabetically sorted)**: Quick search by flipping to approximate location and scanning down - efficient

**Unstructured (subscription order)**: Must scan entire directory sequentially, name by name, page by page - extremely inefficient

This illustrates that the same search algorithm performs drastically differently depending on how the data is organized. Appropriate data structures are essential for efficient algorithms.
