## Greedy Method Strategy

What is the greedy method algorithm design technique and what is its key characteristic?

---

The greedy method is an algorithm design strategy that makes locally optimal choices at each step, hoping that these local optimums lead to a global optimum solution.

At each decision point, it selects the option that appears best at that moment without reconsidering previous choices. Examples include Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Huffman coding.
