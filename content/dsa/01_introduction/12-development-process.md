## Algorithm Development Eight-Step Process

At which step in the algorithm development process is the data structure chosen, and why is this timing significant?

---

Data structures are chosen during the **Algorithm Design** phase (step 3 of 8).

**Significance**: The choice of data structure must be made at the design stage because data structures directly influence algorithm efficiency. The right data structure selection impacts:
- Performance measured in Algorithm Analysis (step 6)
- Overall solution efficiency
- Scalability of the implementation

This is why algorithm design and data structure selection must go hand-in-hand.
