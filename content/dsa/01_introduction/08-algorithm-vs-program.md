## Algorithm vs Program Distinction

What is the relationship between an algorithm and a program? Is there a distinction in terms of the finiteness property?

---

An algorithm encoded in a programming language for implementation on a computer is called a program.

However, some argue programs need not exhibit the finiteness property that algorithms require. For example, an operating system is an "infinite" program that terminates only when the system crashes; otherwise it's in "wait" mode. This contrasts with algorithms which must always terminate after finite steps.
