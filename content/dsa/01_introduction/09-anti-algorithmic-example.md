## Anti-Algorithmic Cooking Recipe

Why is a cooking recipe with instructions like "add a pinch of salt" or "fry until golden brown" considered "anti-algorithmic"?

---

Such instructions violate the **definiteness** property of algorithms. Terms like "a pinch" and "golden brown" are ambiguous and subject to interpretation. Valid algorithms require that all steps be precisely and unambiguously defined, with no room for subjective interpretation.
