## Computer Science Problem-Solving Foundation

Why is the "Foundations" sub-area of computer science particularly important for problem-solving?

---

The Foundations sub-area addresses:
- Problem models and their solutions
- Methods for efficient design and implementation
- Performance measurement techniques
- **Core fields like algorithms and data structures**

This is where the fundamental problem-solving capabilities originate. All other areas (Machines, Languages, Technologies) depend on having solid foundational methods for solving problems efficiently.
