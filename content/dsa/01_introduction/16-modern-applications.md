## Modern Applications of Data Structures

Provide four modern real-world applications that rely on specific data structures and algorithms.

---

1. **Recommendation Systems** (Netflix, Spotify): Use graph algorithms and hash tables
2. **GPS Navigation**: Employs shortest-path algorithms on graph structures
3. **Search Engines**: Index billions of pages using trees and hash structures
4. **Machine Learning Models**: Organize training data in specialized structures for efficient access and processing
