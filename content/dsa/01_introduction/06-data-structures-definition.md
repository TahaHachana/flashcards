## Data Structures Definition

What are data structures and why are they important in algorithm design?

---

Data structures are methods, techniques, and tools used to organize and structure data efficiently. They are critically important because the choice of data structure directly impacts algorithm efficiency. Good algorithm design must go hand in hand with appropriate data structures - the same algorithm can perform vastly differently depending on how data is organized.
