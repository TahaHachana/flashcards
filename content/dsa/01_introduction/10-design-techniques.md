## Algorithm Design Techniques

What is the difference between brute force methods and strategic algorithm design techniques? Name three popular strategic methods.

---

**Brute Force**: Try all possible combinations without exploiting problem characteristics or data structure properties (e.g., sequential search through entire list)

**Strategic Methods**: Exploit problem characteristics and structure for efficiency. Three popular techniques:
1. **Divide and Conquer**: Break problem into smaller subproblems
2. **Greedy Method**: Make locally optimal choices
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Solve overlapping subproblems once
