## Linear vs Nonlinear Data Structures

What is the difference between linear and nonlinear data structures? Provide examples of each.

---

Linear data structures arrange elements in a sequential, one-dimensional manner (examples: arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists).

Nonlinear data structures arrange elements in hierarchical or network-based, multi-dimensional relationships (examples: trees, graphs, hash tables).
