## NP-Complete and Approximation Algorithms

What are NP-complete and NP-hard problems, and how do approximation algorithms address them?

---

**NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial)**: Problem classes that don't yield efficient solutions regardless of which algorithm design technique is employed.

Despite their practical importance, no efficient algorithms exist for these problems. Therefore:

**Approximation Algorithms**: Use heuristics (intuitive methods) to:
- Deliver near-optimal or acceptable solutions
- Achieve results within reasonable time
- Handle specific problem instances practically

Heuristics are intuitive methods that help attain acceptable solutions when optimal solutions are computationally infeasible.
