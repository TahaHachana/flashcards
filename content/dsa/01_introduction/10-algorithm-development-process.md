## Algorithm Development Process

What are the eight steps in the systematic algorithm development process?

---

1. Problem Statement - Clearly define what needs to be solved
2. Model Formulation - Abstract the problem into a solvable model
3. Algorithm Design - Create the step-by-step solution
4. Correctness Verification - Prove the algorithm produces correct results
5. Implementation - Write the actual code
6. Algorithm Analysis - Measure performance
7. Program Testing - Validate with test cases
8. Documentation - Record design decisions and usage
