## Dynamic Programming Strategy

What is dynamic programming and how does it differ from simple recursion?

---

Dynamic programming is an algorithm design technique that breaks down problems into subproblems and stores the results of overlapping subproblems to avoid redundant computation.

Unlike simple recursion which may solve the same subproblem multiple times, dynamic programming solves each subproblem once and reuses the stored result. Examples include the Fibonacci sequence calculation and the knapsack problem.
