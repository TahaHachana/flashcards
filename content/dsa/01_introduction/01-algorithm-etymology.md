## Algorithm Etymology and First Designer

What is the origin of the word "algorithm" and who designed the first algorithm?

---

The word "algorithm" comes from "algorism," linked to Arabic mathematician Abu Jafar Mohammed Ibn Musa Al Khwarizmi (825 CE). He designed the first algorithm for adding numbers in the Hindu numeral system, which involved summing digits at each position with carries, moving from least to most significant digit.
