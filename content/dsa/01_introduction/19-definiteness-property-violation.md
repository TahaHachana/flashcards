## Definiteness Property Violation

Why are cooking recipe instructions like "add a pinch of salt" or "fry until golden brown" considered anti-algorithmic?

---

These instructions violate the definiteness property of algorithms, which requires that each step must be precisely and unambiguously defined.

Terms like "a pinch" and "golden brown" are subjective and open to interpretation - different people will understand them differently. An algorithm must have steps clear enough that any person (or computer) following them will produce the same result.
