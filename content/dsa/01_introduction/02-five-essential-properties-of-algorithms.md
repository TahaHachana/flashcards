## Five Essential Properties of Algorithms

What are the five essential properties that a procedure must satisfy to be considered an algorithm?

---

1. Finiteness - Must terminate after a finite number of steps
2. Definiteness - Each step must be precisely and unambiguously defined
3. Generality - Should solve all problems of a particular class, not just specific instances
4. Effectiveness - Operations must be basic enough to be performed manually
5. Input-Output - Must have well-defined inputs and produce outputs
