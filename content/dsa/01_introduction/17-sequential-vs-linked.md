## Sequential vs Linked Data Structures

What are the two classifications of linear data structures? Give examples of each.

---

**Sequential Representations**: Fixed-size, contiguous memory
- Arrays
- Stacks (array-based)
- Queues (array-based)

**Linked Representations**: Dynamic, pointer-based
- Linked Lists
- Linked Stacks
- Linked Queues

Both are linear (unidimensional) but differ in their memory allocation and access patterns.
