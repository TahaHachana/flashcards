## Brute Force Approach

What is the brute force algorithm design approach and when is it used?

---

Brute force (or exhaustive search) is an approach that tries all possible solutions to find the correct one. It does not employ strategic methods to exploit problem characteristics or data structure properties.

While simple and guaranteed to find a solution if one exists, it is often inefficient. Brute force is useful when no better approach is known or when the problem size is small enough that efficiency doesn't matter.
