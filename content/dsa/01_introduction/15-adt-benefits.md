## ADT Benefits and Characteristics

What are the key benefits of using Abstract Data Types (ADTs) in software design?

---

1. **Promotes data abstraction**: Focuses on WHAT a data structure does, not HOW
2. **Easier comprehension**: Clear interface specification
3. **Implementation independence**: Can be implemented in any programming language
4. **Paradigm independence**: Works with procedural, object-oriented, or functional programming
5. **Flexible design**: Designers can choose which operations to provide based on application needs
6. **Supports composition**: One data structure can use others for implementation (e.g., stacks can be implemented using arrays or lists)
