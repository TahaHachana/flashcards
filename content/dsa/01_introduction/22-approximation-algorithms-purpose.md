## Approximation Algorithms Purpose

What are approximation algorithms and when are they used?

---

Approximation algorithms are designed to find near-optimal solutions for NP-hard and NP-complete problems within reasonable time, rather than exact optimal solutions which may be computationally infeasible.

They use heuristics (intuitive methods) to deliver acceptable solutions in practical time frames. These are important because many NP-hard problems have significant practical applications where a good-enough solution is better than no solution or waiting indefinitely for the optimal one.
