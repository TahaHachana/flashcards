## P vs NP Problem Classes

What is the difference between P-class, NP-complete, and NP-hard problems?

---

P-class problems can be solved in polynomial time (efficient solutions exist).

NP-complete problems have no known efficient solution, but solutions can be verified quickly in polynomial time.

NP-hard problems are at least as hard as NP-complete problems (may be even harder).

For NP-hard and NP-complete problems, approximation algorithms and heuristics are often used to find near-optimal solutions in reasonable time.
