## Algorithm vs Program Distinction

What is the relationship between an algorithm and a program?

---

A program is an algorithm encoded in a programming language for execution on a computer.

Algorithms are language-independent and can be expressed in natural language, pseudocode, flowcharts, or any notation. Programs are the concrete implementation of algorithms in specific programming languages.

Some argue programs may not require the finiteness property (example: operating systems run indefinitely), while algorithms must always terminate.
