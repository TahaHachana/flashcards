## Social Network Search Example

How does the social network friend search example illustrate the importance of data structures in modern applications?

---

**Structured (hash table or search tree)**: Can find any friend among millions of users in milliseconds - practical for real-world use

**Unstructured (simple list)**: Must check every user sequentially - completely impractical at the scale of modern social networks with billions of users

This demonstrates that proper data structure selection is not just about efficiency but about making applications feasible at scale.
