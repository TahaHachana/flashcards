## When to Use Arrays

When should you use arrays, and when should you avoid them?

---

Use arrays when:
✓ Maximum size is known in advance
✓ Need fast random access to elements
✓ Primarily read/traverse data
✓ Memory is at a premium
✓ Elements are of the same type

Avoid arrays when:
✗ Size changes frequently
✗ Many insertions/deletions in the middle
✗ Need to store heterogeneous data
✗ Need to frequently grow the collection

Consider dynamic arrays or linked structures for scenarios where arrays are unsuitable.
