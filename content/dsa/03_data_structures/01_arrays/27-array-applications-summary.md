## Array Applications Summary

What are the four main applications of arrays discussed, and what problem does each solve?

---

Four main array applications:

1. Sparse Matrices
   - Problem: Wasted memory for mostly-zero matrices
   - Solution: Store only non-zero elements as (row, col, value) triplets

2. Ordered Lists
   - Problem: Need sequential data with order preservation
   - Solution: Use 1D array with insert/delete/update operations

3. Strings
   - Problem: Need to store and manipulate text
   - Solution: Array of characters with null terminator

4. Bit Arrays
   - Problem: Space-efficient boolean storage
   - Solution: Each element is a single bit, with bitwise operations

Each leverages arrays' strengths while addressing specific use cases.
