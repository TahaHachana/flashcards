## Ordered List Operations

What is an ordered list and what are its three main operations?

---

Ordered list: A linear sequence where the order of elements matters, implemented as a one-dimensional array.

Three main operations:

1. Insertion - Insert element at specific position
   Example: (a₁, a₂, a₇, a₉) → Insert a₆ → (a₁, a₂, a₆, a₇, a₉)

2. Deletion - Remove element at specific position
   Example: (a₁, a₂, a₇, a₉) → Delete a₉ → (a₁, a₂, a₇)

3. Update - Replace element at specific position
   Example: (a₁, a₂, a₇, a₉) → Update a₂ to a₅ → (a₁, a₅, a₇, a₉)
