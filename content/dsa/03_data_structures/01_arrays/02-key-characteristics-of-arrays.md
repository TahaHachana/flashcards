## Key Characteristics of Arrays

What are the five key characteristics that define arrays?

---

1. Homogeneous elements - All elements must be of the same data type
2. Fixed size - Number of elements determined at creation (for static arrays)
3. Contiguous memory - Elements stored in adjacent memory locations
4. Index-based access - Elements accessed by their position
5. Random access - Can directly access any element in O(1) time without traversing previous elements
