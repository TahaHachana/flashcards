## Arrays vs Linked Lists Comparison

Compare arrays and linked lists across key performance metrics.

---

Arrays vs Linked Lists:

Access time: O(1) vs O(n)
Insert/Delete at end: O(1) vs O(1)
Insert/Delete in middle: O(n) vs O(1)* 
Memory overhead: Minimal vs High (pointers)
Memory layout: Contiguous vs Scattered
Size: Fixed (static) vs Dynamic
Cache performance: Excellent vs Poor

*O(1) for linked lists only if position is already known

Key insight: Arrays excel at random access and memory efficiency; linked lists excel at dynamic size changes and middle insertions/deletions.
