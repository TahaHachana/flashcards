## Array ADT Definition

What is an array as an Abstract Data Type (ADT), and what are its two fundamental operations?

---

An array is an ADT whose data objects are a sequence of elements of the same type.

The two fundamental operations are:
1. STORE(array, index, element) - Write a value to a specific position
2. RETRIEVE(array, index) - Read a value from a specific position

In programming terms: array[i] = value (STORE) and value = array[i] (RETRIEVE)
