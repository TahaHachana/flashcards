## Array Disadvantages

What are the five main disadvantages of static arrays?

---

1. Fixed Size - Cannot grow or shrink after creation
2. Expensive Insertion/Deletion - O(n) time for operations in the middle
3. Wasted Space - Must allocate maximum needed size upfront
4. Same Data Type - All elements must be of the same type (homogeneous)
5. No Built-in Operations - Limited to STORE and RETRIEVE primitives

These limitations make arrays unsuitable for collections with frequently changing sizes.
