## Array Operations Performance Summary

Summarize the time complexity of all major array operations.

---

Array Operations Time Complexity:

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Access/Update | O(1) | Direct calculation |
| Traverse | O(n) | Visit each element |
| Search (unsorted) | O(n) | Linear scan |
| Search (sorted) | O(log n) | Binary search |
| Insert/Delete (middle) | O(n) | Requires shifting |
| Insert/Delete (end) | O(1) | No shifting |

The O(1) access time is arrays' superpower, making them ideal for random access patterns.
