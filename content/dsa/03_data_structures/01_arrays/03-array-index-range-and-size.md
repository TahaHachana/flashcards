## Array Index Range and Size

For an array A[l:u], what do l and u represent, and what is the formula for the number of elements?

---

l = lower bound (first index)
u = upper bound (last index)

Number of elements = u - l + 1

Example: A[1:5] has 5 - 1 + 1 = 5 elements
Example: A[-2:3] has 3 - (-2) + 1 = 6 elements
