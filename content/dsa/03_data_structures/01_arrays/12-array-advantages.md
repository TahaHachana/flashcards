1. Fast Random Access - O(1) time to access any element by index
2. Memory Efficiency - Minimal overhead, just stores data
3. Cache Friendly - Contiguous memory improves cache performance
4. Simple Implementation - Easy to understand and use
5. Predictable Performance - Fixed size means predictable memory usage

Arrays excel when you need direct access to elements and the size is known in advance.
