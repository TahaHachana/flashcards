## Algorithm Efficiency

What two main factors are analyzed to evaluate algorithm efficiency?

---

- **Time complexity**: how running time grows with input size.  
- **Space complexity**: how memory usage grows with input size.  
Both are commonly expressed using **asymptotic notation** (Big-O, Ω, Θ).
