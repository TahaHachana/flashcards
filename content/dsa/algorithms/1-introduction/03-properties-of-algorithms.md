What are the key properties of a good algorithm?

---

- **Correctness**: always produces the intended output.  
- **Finiteness**: terminates after a finite number of steps.  
- **Definiteness**: each step is precisely defined.  
- **Input & Output**: operates on given input, produces output.  
- **Efficiency**: uses reasonable time and memory resources.
