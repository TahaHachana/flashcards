## Algorithm Development Steps

What are the main steps in developing an algorithm?

---

1. Define the problem (inputs, outputs, constraints).  
2. Design the algorithm (pseudocode, flowcharts).  
3. Prove correctness.  
4. Analyze efficiency (time and space).  
5. Implement in a programming language.  
6. Test with examples and counterexamples.
