## A Priori Vs A Posteriori

What is the difference between a priori and a posteriori analysis of algorithms?

---

- **A priori**: Theoretical analysis before coding, based on counting steps. Independent of hardware/software.  
- **A posteriori**: Experimental analysis after coding, based on execution time. Dependent on platform and environment.
