## Polynomial Vs Exponential

Why are polynomial-time algorithms considered feasible while exponential ones are not?

---

* **Polynomial-time (O(n^k))**: Growth is manageable even for large inputs.
* **Exponential-time (O(2^n), O(n!))**: Growth explodes rapidly, making algorithms impractical for large `n`.
