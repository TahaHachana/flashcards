## Best Worst Average Case Definitions

Define best case, worst case, and average case complexity. Which is most commonly analyzed and why?

---

**Best Case**: Minimum time over all possible inputs of size n (optimistic)
**Worst Case**: Maximum time over all possible inputs of size n (pessimistic)
**Average Case**: Average time over all possible inputs of size n (realistic but hardest)

**Most commonly analyzed**: Worst case
**Why**: Provides guaranteed upper bound on performance, critical for real-time and safety-critical systems where you must ensure response within time limits.
