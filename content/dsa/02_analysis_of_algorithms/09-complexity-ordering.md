## Common Time Complexities Ordering

Order these time complexities from most efficient to least efficient: O(2ⁿ), O(n²), O(n log n), O(1), O(log n), O(n³), O(n)

---

From most efficient to least efficient:

O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n²) < O(n³) < O(2ⁿ)

**Key insight**: Logarithmic is better than linear, linearithmic (n log n) is better than quadratic, and exponential is dramatically worse than any polynomial complexity.
