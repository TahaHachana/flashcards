## Big Omega Notation Definition

Define Big Omega notation Ω(g(n)) and explain what it represents.

---

f(n) = Ω(g(n)) if there exist positive constants C and n₀ such that |f(n)| ≥ C|g(n)| for all n ≥ n₀.

Big Omega represents a lower bound on the growth rate. It means that f(n) grows at least as fast as g(n) for sufficiently large n. In practical terms, it describes the best-case or minimum performance of an algorithm.
