## Worst Case Complexity

What is worst case complexity and when is it most important?

---

Worst case complexity is the maximum time an algorithm takes over all possible input instances of size n. It represents the least favorable scenario.

Example: In linear search, the worst case is O(n) when the target element is the last element or not present.

Worst case analysis is most important in safety-critical systems where response time limits must be guaranteed (e.g., nuclear plant controllers, medical devices, real-time systems).
