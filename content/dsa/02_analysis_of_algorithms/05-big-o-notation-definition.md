## Big O Notation Definition

Define Big O notation O(g(n)) and explain what it represents.

---

f(n) = O(g(n)) if there exist positive constants C and n₀ such that |f(n)| ≤ C|g(n)| for all n ≥ n₀.

Big O represents an upper bound on the growth rate of a function. It means that g(n) grows at least as fast as f(n) for sufficiently large n. In practical terms, it describes the worst-case performance of an algorithm.
