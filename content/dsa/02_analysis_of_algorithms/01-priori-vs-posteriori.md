## A Priori vs A Posteriori Analysis

What are the key differences between a priori (theoretical) and a posteriori (empirical) analysis? Which is preferred and why?

---

**A Posteriori (Empirical)**: Implement and execute algorithms, measure actual execution times. Disadvantages: machine-dependent, language-dependent, programmer-dependent, limited to testable input sizes.

**A Priori (Theoretical)**: Mathematically determine resources needed as function of input size. Advantages: machine/language/programmer-independent, can analyze for any input size.

**Preferred**: A priori analysis because it provides objective, implementation-independent measurements that work for any input size.
