## Why Big O Most Common

Why is Big O notation more commonly used in practice than Ω or Θ notations?

---

**Practical reasons**:
1. **Upper bound is most useful**: Guarantees algorithm won't exceed certain time
2. **Easier to derive**: Finding tight bounds (Θ) requires proving both upper and lower bounds
3. **Risk management**: Knowing worst-case upper bound helps ensure systems meet requirements
4. **Industry standard**: Big O became conventional for communicating algorithm efficiency

While Θ provides more precise information, O is sufficient for most practical algorithm comparisons and system design decisions.
