## Common Time Complexity Classes

List the common time complexity classes from best to worst and provide one example algorithm for each.

---

From best to worst:
- O(1) - Constant: Array access by index
- O(log n) - Logarithmic: Binary search
- O(n) - Linear: Linear search
- O(n log n) - Linearithmic: Merge sort, heap sort
- O(n²) - Quadratic: Bubble sort, selection sort
- O(n³) - Cubic: Simple matrix multiplication
- O(2ⁿ) - Exponential: Tower of Hanoi, generating all subsets
