## Average Case Complexity

What is average case complexity and what makes it challenging to compute?

---

Average case complexity is the expected performance across all possible input instances, weighted by their probability of occurrence.

It is challenging to compute because:
- It requires knowing or assuming the probability distribution of inputs
- The mathematical analysis is often complex
- It must account for all possible input configurations

Average case is more realistic for general-purpose software but worst case is still preferred in academic analysis due to its simplicity and guaranteed bounds.
