## Frequency Count Definition

What is a frequency count in algorithm analysis and how is it used?

---

Frequency count is the number of times a statement is executed during program execution.

It is used in apriori analysis by: counting how many times each statement executes, summing all frequency counts to get total operations, expressing this sum as a mathematical function T(n), and then approximating T(n) using asymptotic notation.
