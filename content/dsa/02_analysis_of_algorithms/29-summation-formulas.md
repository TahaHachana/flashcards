## Summation Formulas for Analysis

What are the three fundamental summation formulas used in algorithm analysis, and when is each typically used?

---

**1. Σ(i=1 to n) 1 = n**
- Used for: Counting iterations of simple loops

**2. Σ(i=1 to n) i = n(n+1)/2**
- Used for: Nested loops where inner bound depends on outer (triangular pattern)

**3. Σ(i=1 to n) i² = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6**
- Used for: More complex nested loop patterns

These formulas help convert frequency counts into closed-form expressions that can be analyzed asymptotically.
