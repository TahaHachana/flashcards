## Recurrence Relations

What is a recurrence relation and what are the general steps to analyze a recursive algorithm?

---

A recurrence relation is an equation that defines a function T(n) in terms of itself with smaller arguments.

General steps:
1. Define T(n) for the base case(s)
2. Define T(n) for the recursive case(s) in terms of T(smaller values)
3. Solve the recurrence by substitution to get a closed-form solution
4. Express the solution using Big O notation

Recurrence relations are essential for analyzing the time complexity of recursive algorithms.
