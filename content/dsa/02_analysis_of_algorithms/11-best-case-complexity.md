## Best Case Complexity

What is best case complexity and when is it useful to analyze?

---

Best case complexity is the minimum time an algorithm takes over all possible input instances of size n. It represents the most favorable scenario for the algorithm.

Example: In linear search, the best case is O(1) when the target element is the first element.

Best case analysis is rarely used except for special algorithms where the best case scenario is common (e.g., insertion sort on nearly-sorted data).
