## Constant Time Operations

What types of operations are considered O(1) constant time, and why?

---

O(1) constant time operations include:
- Array access by index: array[5]
- Simple arithmetic: a + b, x * y
- Variable assignment: x = 10
- Comparison: if (a > b)
- Basic pointer operations

These are O(1) because they take a fixed amount of time regardless of input size. They involve a fixed number of machine instructions that don't depend on the size of the data structure or input.
