## Time Complexity vs Space Complexity

What is the difference between time complexity and space complexity in algorithm analysis?

---

Time complexity is a function of the running time of an algorithm, measuring how execution time grows as input size increases.

Space complexity is a function of the memory space required for execution, measuring how memory usage grows as input size increases.

Time complexity is typically the primary focus unless memory is severely constrained.
