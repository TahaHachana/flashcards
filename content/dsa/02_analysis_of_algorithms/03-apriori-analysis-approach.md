## Apriori Analysis Approach

What is apriori analysis and why is it preferred over posteriori testing?

---

Apriori analysis mathematically determines resources needed and expresses performance as a function of input parameters using asymptotic notation.

It is preferred because it is machine-independent, language-independent, programmer-independent, works for arbitrarily large inputs, and enables early decision-making before implementation.
