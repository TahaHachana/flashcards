## Posteriori Testing Approach

What is posteriori testing (empirical approach) and what are its main advantages and disadvantages?

---

Posteriori testing involves implementing all candidate algorithms, executing them on a computer with various inputs, and measuring actual execution times.

Advantages: Provides real, concrete measurements on actual hardware.

Disadvantages: Machine-dependent, language-dependent, programmer-dependent, labor-intensive, and limited to inputs that fit in available memory.
