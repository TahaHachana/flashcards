## Why Branching is Essential

Why is branching considered essential to Git workflows?

---

Branching enables:
1. **Parallel development**: Multiple features simultaneously without interference
2. **Safe experimentation**: Try ideas without affecting main code
3. **Isolation**: Keep work-in-progress separate from stable code
4. **Collaboration**: Each developer works on their own branch
5. **Organization**: Separate features, bugfixes, and releases
6. **Risk-free**: Easy to discard failed experiments

Git's lightweight branches (just pointers) make this workflow fast and efficient. Master branching earlyâ€”it's fundamental to professional Git usage.
