## Branch Best Practices

What are key best practices for working with Git branches?

---

- Create branches liberally (for every feature, bugfix, experiment)
- Keep branches short-lived (create → work → merge → delete)
- Use descriptive, consistent naming (feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/)
- One branch = one purpose (don't mix unrelated work)
- Don't accumulate stale branches
- Use prefixes for organization (feature/login, bugfix/navbar)
- Include ticket numbers when applicable (feature/JIRA-123-search)

Branch hygiene prevents repository clutter and confusion.
