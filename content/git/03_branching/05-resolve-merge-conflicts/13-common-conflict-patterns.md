## Common Conflict Patterns

What are three common conflict patterns and their resolutions?

---

1. Formatting conflicts (one branch reformatted):
   - Resolution: Use consistent formatting

2. Import conflicts (both add different imports):
   ```javascript
   // Combine
   import { A, B, C } from 'module';
   ```

3. Configuration conflicts (both modify same setting):
   - Resolution: Decide based on requirements or make configurable

Understanding patterns helps resolve similar conflicts faster.
