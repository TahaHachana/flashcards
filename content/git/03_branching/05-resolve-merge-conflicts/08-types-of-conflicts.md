## Types of Conflicts

What are the main types of merge conflicts?

---

1. Content conflicts (most common):
   - Both modified: `both modified: file.txt`
   - Same lines changed differently

2. Delete/Modify conflicts:
   - One deletes, other modifies: `deleted by us: config.txt`

3. Add/Add conflicts:
   - Both add same file: `both added: utils.js`

4. Rename/Modify conflicts:
   - One renames, other modifies

Resolution depends on type—content conflicts require editing, delete/modify needs decision to keep or remove.
