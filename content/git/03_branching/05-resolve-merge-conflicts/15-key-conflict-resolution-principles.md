## Key Conflict Resolution Principles

What are the essential principles to remember about resolving merge conflicts?

---

1. Conflicts are normal in collaborative development
2. Conflict markers show three sections (HEAD, separator, incoming)
3. Always remove ALL markers completely before committing
4. `git add` marks resolution for each file
5. Test after resolving to catch logical errors
6. `git merge --abort` safely cancels problematic merges
7. Communication prevents conflicts better than resolution skills
8. Short-lived branches reduce conflict likelihood
9. Use tools (IDE, mergetool) for complex conflicts
10. Document resolutions in commit messages

Practice makes perfect—conflict resolution is a critical Git skill!
