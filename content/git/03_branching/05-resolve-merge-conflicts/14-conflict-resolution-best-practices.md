## Conflict Resolution Best Practices

What are key best practices during and after conflict resolution?

---

During resolution:
- Read both versions carefully
- Understand intent of each change
- Test after resolving each file if possible
- Communicate with commit authors if unclear
- Preserve functionality over style

After resolution:
- Run full test suite
- Manual testing of affected features
- Code review if working in team
- Document resolution in merge commit message

Always prioritize correctness and functionality.
