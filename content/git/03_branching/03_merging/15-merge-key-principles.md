## Merge Key Principles

What are the essential principles to remember about Git merging?

---

1. Merge brings changes INTO current branch from another
2. Always switch to target branch first before merging
3. Merge commits have two parents (preserves full history)
4. Clean working tree required before merging
5. Delete feature branches after merging for cleanliness
6. Conflicts require manual resolution
7. `git merge --abort` cancels problematic merges
8. Always test after merging

Remember: `git switch target` then `git merge source`
