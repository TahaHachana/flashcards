## Merge vs Rebase

What's the key difference between merge and rebase?

---

Merge:
- Preserves complete history
- Creates merge commit
- Safe for shared branches
- Standard way to integrate branches

Rebase:
- Rewrites history (linear)
- No merge commit
- Dangerous for shared branches
- Used for cleaning up local history

Use merge as defaultâ€”it's safe and preserves full project history. Rebase is covered later in roadmap.
