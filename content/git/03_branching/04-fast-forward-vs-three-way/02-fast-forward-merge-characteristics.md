## Fast-Forward Merge Characteristics

What are the key characteristics of a fast-forward merge?

---

- No merge commit created
- Linear history (clean, easy to follow)
- Fastest merge (just pointer movement)
- No conflicts possible (no divergent changes)
- Preserves chronological order
- Target branch unchanged since branching

Git message: "Fast-forward"

This is the simplest merge type, essentially just moving a branch pointer forward along the commit history.
