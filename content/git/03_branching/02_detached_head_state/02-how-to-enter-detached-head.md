## How to Enter Detached HEAD

What are four ways to enter detached HEAD state?

---

1. Checkout specific commit: `git checkout a1b2c3d`
2. Checkout a tag: `git checkout v1.0.0`
3. Checkout remote branch: `git checkout origin/main`
4. Checkout relative reference: `git checkout HEAD~3`

Git displays a warning explaining you're in detached HEAD state and suggests creating a branch if you want to keep any commits you make.
