---

1. **Clean, linear history**: Easier to read `git log`, simpler to understand
2. **Easier bisecting**: `git bisect` works better with linear history
3. **Cleaner pull requests**: Reviewers see logical progression, no merge clutter
4. **Simpler reverting**: Can revert individual commits easily

Result: Professional-looking history that's easy to navigate and understand. Good for open-source projects and teams that value clean commit history.
