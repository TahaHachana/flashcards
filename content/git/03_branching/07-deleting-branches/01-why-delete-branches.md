## Why Delete Branches

Why should branches be deleted after merging or abandoning work?

---

Branches should be deleted to:
- Keep branch list clean and manageable
- Avoid confusion about what's active
- Reduce repository clutter
- Signal work is complete

Key concept: Deleting a branch only removes the pointer. If commits were merged, they remain in history and are safe. Branch deletion is just housekeeping.
