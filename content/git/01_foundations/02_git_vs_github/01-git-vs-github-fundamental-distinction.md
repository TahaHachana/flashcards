## Git vs GitHub Fundamental Distinction

What is the fundamental difference between Git and GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket?

---

Git is the version control system (software/tool) that runs on your local computer. GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket are web-based hosting platforms (services) that use Git and add collaboration features.

Analogy: Git is like email (the protocol/technology), GitHub is like Gmail (a service that uses email).
