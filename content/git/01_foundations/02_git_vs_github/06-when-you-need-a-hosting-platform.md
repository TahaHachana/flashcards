## When You Need a Hosting Platform

When do you need a Git hosting platform (GitHub/GitLab) vs. when can you use Git alone?

---

You can use Git ALONE for:
- Solo personal projects, local-only work, no need for cloud backup

You SHOULD use a platform for:
- Backing up code to the cloud
- Collaborating with others
- Showcasing work (portfolio)
- Contributing to open-source
- CI/CD and automation
- Accessing code from multiple machines
