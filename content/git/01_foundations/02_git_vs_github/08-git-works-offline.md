## Git Works Offline

Does Git require internet connection to function, and when is internet needed?

---

Git works COMPLETELY OFFLINE for all core operations (commits, branches, merges, viewing history). Internet is ONLY needed for:
- Pushing changes to remote platforms (GitHub/GitLab)
- Pulling changes from remote platforms
- Cloning remote repositories

All version control happens locally on your machine.
