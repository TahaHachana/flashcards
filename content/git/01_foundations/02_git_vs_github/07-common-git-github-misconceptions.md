## Common Git/GitHub Misconceptions

What are three common misconceptions about Git and GitHub?

---

1. "I need GitHub to use Git" - FALSE: Git works entirely independently
2. "GitHub owns Git" - FALSE: Git is open-source; GitHub is a private company (Microsoft) that builds services around Git
3. "My code is automatically on GitHub when I commit" - FALSE: Commits are local by default; you must explicitly push to send changes to GitHub
