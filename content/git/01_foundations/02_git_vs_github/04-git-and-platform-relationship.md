## Git and Platform Relationship

How do Git and hosting platforms (like GitHub) work together in a typical workflow?

---

1. You use Git locally to track changes on your computer
2. You push to a platform (GitHub/GitLab) to share your work
3. The platform stores a copy of your Git repository remotely
4. Others can pull from the platform to get your changes
5. The platform adds collaboration tools on top

Flow: Your Computer (Git) ←→ GitHub/GitLab (Git + extras) ←→ Teammate's Computer (Git)
