## Git vs GitHub Distinction

What is the critical distinction between Git and GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket?

---

Git is the version control software that runs on your computer (like an email protocol). GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket are web-based hosting platforms that use Git and add collaboration features like pull requests, issue tracking, and web interfaces (like Gmail is to email). You can use Git entirely locally without these platforms.
