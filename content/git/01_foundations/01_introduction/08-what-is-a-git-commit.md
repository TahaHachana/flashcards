## What is a Git Commit

What is a Git commit and what does it contain?

A commit is a complete snapshot of your entire project at a specific moment. It contains: the complete state of all tracked files, a unique identifier (SHA-1 hash), metadata (author, timestamp, message), and pointer(s) to parent commit(s) forming a history chain.
