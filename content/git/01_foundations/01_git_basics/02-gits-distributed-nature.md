## Git's Distributed Nature

What does "distributed" mean in the context of Git as a DVCS, and why is this significant?

---

Every developer has a complete copy of the project history locally, not just the latest files. This means no single point of failure, ability to work offline, and fast operations since most work happens locally without network latency. Contrast with older centralized systems (like SVN) that required constant server connection.
