## Required Git Configuration

What are the two mandatory Git configuration settings you must set before making your first commit, and what commands set them?

---

1. Username: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
2. Email: `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`

These settings are embedded in every commit you make and become permanent in the project history.
