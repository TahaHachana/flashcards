## Default Branch Configuration

What command sets the default branch name to "main" for newly created repositories, and why is this configuration recommended?

---

`git config --global init.defaultBranch main`

This sets "main" as the default instead of the historical "master". "Main" is now the modern convention adopted by GitHub and the broader Git community for new projects.
