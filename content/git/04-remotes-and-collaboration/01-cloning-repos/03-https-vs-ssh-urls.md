## HTTPS vs SSH URLs

What's the difference between HTTPS and SSH URLs for cloning?

---

HTTPS (https://github.com/user/repo.git):
- Works everywhere (no firewall issues)
- Requires username/password or token
- Easy for beginners
- Good for public repos

SSH (git@github.com:user/repo.git):
- Requires SSH key setup
- No password prompt (uses keys)
- More secure for repeated access
- Preferred for regular contributors

Choose HTTPS for simplicity, SSH for regular work.
