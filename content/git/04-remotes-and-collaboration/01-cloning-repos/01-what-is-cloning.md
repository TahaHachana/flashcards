## What is Cloning

What is cloning in Git and what does it include?

---

Cloning creates a complete local copy of a remote repository, including:
- All files and directories
- Complete commit history
- All branches and tags
- Remote connection configuration

Key difference from downloading ZIP: Cloning gives you a fully functional Git repository with all history and the ability to push/pull changes.

Command: `git clone <repository-url>`
