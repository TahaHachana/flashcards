## What are Remotes

What are remotes in Git and why are they useful?

---

Remotes are references (bookmarks) to other repositories, typically hosted on servers like GitHub or GitLab.

Purpose:
- Share code with others
- Back up your work
- Collaborate on projects
- Synchronize changes across machines

Key concept: Remotes are just URLs to other repositories. Your local repository can connect to multiple remotes.

Example: `origin` → `https://github.com/user/project.git`
