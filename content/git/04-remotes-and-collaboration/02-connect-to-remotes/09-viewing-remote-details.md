## Viewing Remote Details

How do you view detailed information about a remote?

---

```bash
git remote show <name>
```

Example:
```bash
git remote show origin
```

Shows:
- Fetch/push URLs
- HEAD branch
- Remote branches
- Tracking relationships
- Branch status (up to date, ahead, behind)

Useful for debugging push/pull issues and understanding remote configuration.
