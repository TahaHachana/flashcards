## Common Remote Setup Patterns

What are three common remote configuration patterns?

---

1. Single remote (origin):
   - Clone: origin configured automatically
   - Use: Direct repository access

2. Fork workflow (origin + upstream):
   - origin: Your fork (push here)
   - upstream: Original repo (pull from here)

3. Multiple backups:
   - github, gitlab, company-server
   - Push to all for redundancy
   - Different deployment targets

Choose based on collaboration needs and backup strategy.
