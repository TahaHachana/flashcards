## Key Remote Principles

What are the essential principles about Git remotes?

---

1. Remotes are bookmarks (URLs) to other repositories
2. `origin` is default name (convention, not requirement)
3. Multiple remotes allowed (origin, upstream, etc.)
4. `git remote -v` shows remotes with URLs
5. Add: `git remote add`, Remove: `git remote remove`
6. Change URL: `git remote set-url`
7. Remote branches shown with `git branch -r`
8. Fork workflow: origin (yours) + upstream (original)
9. Configuration stored in `.git/config`
10. Always verify remotes before push/pull

Understanding remotes is essential for Git collaboration!
