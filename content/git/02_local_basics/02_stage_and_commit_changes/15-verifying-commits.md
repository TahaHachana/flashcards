## Verifying Commits

What are four ways to verify and view commits after committing?

---

1. `git log`: View complete commit history
2. `git show` or `git show HEAD`: View last commit details
3. `git log --oneline`: View commit history in condensed one-line format
4. `git rev-list --count HEAD`: Count total number of commits

These commands help verify your commit was successful and review what was committed.
