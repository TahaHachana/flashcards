## Purpose of git add

What does `git add` do, and what does it NOT do?

---

`git add` DOES:
- Take a snapshot of the file's current state
- Store it in the staging area
- Mark the file as "ready to commit"
- Leave the working directory file unchanged

`git add` does NOT:
- Commit anything (it only prepares files)
- Automatically include future changes to the file
- Add files to the repository permanently
