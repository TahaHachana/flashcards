## The Two-Step Commit Process

What are the two steps in Git's commit process and why does Git use this approach?

---

1. Stage changes with `git add` (select what to include)
2. Commit staged changes with `git commit` (save the snapshot)

This gives precise control over what goes into each commit, allowing you to commit only related changes together, review before committing, and create logical, focused commits.
