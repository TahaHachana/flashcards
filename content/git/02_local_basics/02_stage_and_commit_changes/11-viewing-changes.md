## Viewing Changes

What's the difference between `git diff` and `git diff --staged`?

---

- `git diff`: Shows unstaged changes (changes in working directory not yet staged)
- `git diff --staged` (or `git diff --cached`): Shows staged changes (what will be included in next commit)

Use `git diff --staged` to review exactly what you're about to commit.
