## Commit Message Best Practices

What are the key guidelines for writing good Git commit messages?

---

DO:
- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Start with capital letter
- Explain WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Be specific and descriptive

DON'T:
- Write vague messages ("fix bug", "update code")
- Use past tense
- Include unnecessary details
- Commit unrelated changes together
