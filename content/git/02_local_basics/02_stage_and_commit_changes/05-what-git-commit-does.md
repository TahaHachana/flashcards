## What git commit Does

What happens when you run `git commit`?

---

1. Creates a snapshot of all staged changes
2. Generates a unique SHA-1 hash (commit ID)
3. Stores commit metadata (author, date, message)
4. Links to parent commit (creating history chain)
5. Moves the current branch pointer forward
6. Clears the staging area

Result: Changes are permanently saved in repository history.
