## The Three Areas of Git Workflow

What are the three areas changes flow through in Git, and what does each represent?

---

1. Working Directory: Your actual files where you make changes (modified state)
2. Staging Area (Index): A holding area for changes you want to commit (staged state)
3. Repository (.git directory): Permanent storage of committed snapshots (committed state)

Flow: Working Directory → Staging Area → Repository
