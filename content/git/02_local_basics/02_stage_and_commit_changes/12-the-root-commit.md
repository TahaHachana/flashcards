## The Root Commit

What is special about the first commit in a Git repository?

---

The first commit is called the "root commit" and has these special properties:
- It has no parent commit
- Forms the base of the entire project history
- Shown as `(root-commit)` in commit output
- Convention: Often messaged as "Initial commit" or "Initial project setup"

Every other commit descends from this root commit.
