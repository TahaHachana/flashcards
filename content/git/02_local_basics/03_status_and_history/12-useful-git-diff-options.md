## Useful git diff Options

What do these git diff options do: `--name-only`, `--stat`, `-w`, `--word-diff`?

---

- `git diff --name-only`: Show only file names that changed
- `git diff --name-status`: Show file names with status (M/A/D)
- `git diff --stat`: Show statistics (files changed, insertions/deletions)
- `git diff -w` or `--ignore-all-space`: Ignore whitespace changes
- `git diff --word-diff`: Show word-level changes instead of line-level

Use `--stat` for quick overview, `--word-diff` for prose/documentation.
