## Purpose of git status

What does `git status` show and when should you use it?

---

`git status` shows the working tree status: what's changed, staged, or untracked. It displays:
1. Current branch and tracking status
2. Changes to be committed (staged, green)
3. Changes not staged for commit (modified, red)
4. Untracked files (new files Git doesn't know about, red)

Best practice: Run `git status` constantlyâ€”before and after nearly every Git operation.
