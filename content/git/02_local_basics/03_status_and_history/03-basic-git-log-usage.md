## Basic git log Usage

What does `git log` display by default and what information does each commit show?

---

`git log` shows the commit history. Each commit displays:
- Full commit hash (SHA-1 identifier)
- Author name and email
- Date and time
- Commit message
- Branch/tag references (if any)

Commits are shown in reverse chronological order (newest first).
