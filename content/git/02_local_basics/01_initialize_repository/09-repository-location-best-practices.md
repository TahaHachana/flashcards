## Repository Location Best Practices

What are best practices for where to initialize Git repositories?

---

DO:
- One repository per project
- Initialize at project root (top-level folder)
- Use meaningful directory names

DON'T:
- Initialize in home directory (~)
- Create nested repositories (unless using submodules)
- Initialize in system folders (Desktop, Documents root)
- Track temporary or cache folders
