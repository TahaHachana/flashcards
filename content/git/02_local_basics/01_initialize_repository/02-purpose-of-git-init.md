## Purpose of git init

What does the `git init` command do, and what does it NOT do?

---

`git init` DOES:
- Create a hidden `.git` subdirectory with repository structure
- Prepare the directory for version control
- Place you on the default branch

`git init` does NOT:
- Create any commits
- Track any files automatically
- Change your existing files
- Upload anything anywhere
