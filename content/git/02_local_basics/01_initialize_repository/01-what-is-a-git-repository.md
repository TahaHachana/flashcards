## What is a Git Repository

What is a Git repository and what are its two main components?

---

A Git repository (repo) is a directory that Git tracks. It contains:
1. Your project files (working directory)
2. A hidden `.git` folder (Git's database storing all history, commits, branches, and metadata)

A directory is just a regular folder until you initialize it as a Git repository.
