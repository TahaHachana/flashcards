## What Happens When You Delete .git

What happens if you delete the `.git` folder from a repository?

---

- ALL Git history is permanently lost (commits, branches, tags)
- Directory becomes a regular folder (no longer a repository)
- Files in working directory remain unchanged (your actual project files are safe)
- This action CANNOT be undoneâ€”history is gone forever

Only delete `.git` if you deliberately want to remove all version control from a project.
