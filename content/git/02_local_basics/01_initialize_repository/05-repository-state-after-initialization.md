## Repository State After Initialization

What is the state of a repository immediately after running `git init`?

---

- Repository is empty (no commits yet)
- No files are tracked by Git
- Working directory may have files, but Git doesn't know about them
- You're on the initial branch (typically `main`)
- `.git` folder exists with empty repository structure

Use `git status` to verify the empty state.
