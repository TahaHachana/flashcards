## What Are Structs and Why Do They Exist?

What is a struct in Rust and what are the three main reasons they exist?

---

A struct (structure) is a custom data type that packages together multiple related values into a meaningful group.

Three main reasons structs exist:
1. **Data organization** - Group related data into logical units
2. **Type safety** - Create domain-specific types instead of using primitives
3. **Code clarity** - Give meaningful names to collections of data

Structs are Rust's primary way of creating custom types, similar to classes in other languages but without inheritance.
