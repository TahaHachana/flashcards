## HashMap Performance Characteristics

What are the time complexities for common HashMap operations?

---

- **Insert**: O(1) average, O(n) worst case (rehashing)
- **Get/lookup**: O(1) average
- **Remove**: O(1) average
- **Contains**: O(1) average
- **Iteration**: O(n) for all entries

Worst case happens during hash collisions or resizing.
