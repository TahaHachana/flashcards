## HashMap Lookup Complexity

What is the average time complexity for HashMap lookups and why is this better than Vec search?

---

Average O(1) constant time using hashing. This is much better than Vec linear search which is O(n). HashMap achieves this by hashing the key to compute its storage location directly.
