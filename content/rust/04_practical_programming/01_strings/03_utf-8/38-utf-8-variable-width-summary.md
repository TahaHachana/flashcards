## UTF-8 Variable Width Summary

What does "variable-width encoding" mean and what's its main consequence for string operations?

---

Variable-width means characters can be different byte sizes (1-4 bytes in UTF-8). Main consequence: byte position â‰  character position.

This makes:
- Direct indexing impossible (which byte/char?)
- Character access O(n) instead of O(1) (must scan)
- Slicing require boundary checks (can't split characters)
- len() return bytes, not characters (ambiguous otherwise)
