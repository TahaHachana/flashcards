## What is UTF-8 Encoding

What is UTF-8 and what are its key characteristics?

---

UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding with these properties:
- Variable-width: Characters can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes
- Backward compatible: ASCII characters (0-127) are exactly 1 byte, same as ASCII
- Efficient: Common characters use fewer bytes
- Universal: Can represent all Unicode characters (over 1 million)
