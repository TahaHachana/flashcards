## Three Core String Operations

What are the three core string manipulation operations in Rust?

---

1. Concatenation - joining strings together to create larger strings
2. Slicing - extracting parts of strings without copying data
3. Iteration - processing strings character by character or byte by byte

These fundamentals enable all text processing in Rust while maintaining safety and performance.
