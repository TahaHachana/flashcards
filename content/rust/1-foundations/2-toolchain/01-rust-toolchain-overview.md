## Rust Toolchain Overview

What are the three core components of the Rust toolchain and what role does each play?

---

1. **`rustup`** – manages installation and updates of Rust toolchains and components.  
2. **`rustc`** – compiles Rust source code into machine code, enforcing safety rules.  
3. **`cargo`** – builds, tests, and manages projects, dependencies, and documentation.
