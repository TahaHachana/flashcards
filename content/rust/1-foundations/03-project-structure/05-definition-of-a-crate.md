## Definition of a Crate

What is a crate in Rust?

---

A **crate** is the smallest unit of compilation and distribution in Rust.
It can be either:

* a **binary crate** with an entry point (`main.rs`), or
* a **library crate** defining reusable code (`lib.rs`).
  Each crate has its own namespace and build output.
