## Key Takeaways â€” Project Structure

Summarize the key ideas about Rust project structure and organization.

---

* Cargo organizes projects using a manifest (`Cargo.toml`) and `src/` directory.
* Each **package** can contain multiple **crates**.
* **Workspaces** group related packages under one build system.
* Modules mirror the file layout inside `src/`.
* The `target/` directory stores all compiled artifacts.
* Cargo automates builds, testing, documentation, and dependency management.
