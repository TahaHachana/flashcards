## Installing cargo-edit Utilities

What is the `cargo-edit` package and why is it useful?

---

`cargo-edit` adds commands like:

```bash
cargo add
cargo rm
cargo upgrade
```

These make dependency management easier by editing `Cargo.toml` automatically.
Install it with:

```bash
cargo install cargo-edit
```
