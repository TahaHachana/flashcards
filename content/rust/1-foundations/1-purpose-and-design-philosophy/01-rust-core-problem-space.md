## Rust’s Core Problem Space

What long-standing problem in systems programming motivated the creation of Rust?

---

Rust was created to bridge the gap between **performance and safety**.  
Traditional systems languages (like C/C++) offer speed and control but allow memory and concurrency bugs,  
while managed languages offer safety at the cost of control.  
Rust provides both — **C-level performance with compile-time memory safety**.
