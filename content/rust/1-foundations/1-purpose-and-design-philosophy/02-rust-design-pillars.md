## Rust’s Three Design Pillars

What are Rust’s three core design goals and how are they achieved?

---

1. **Safety** – ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes enforce valid memory access.  
2. **Speed** – zero-cost abstractions compile to optimized machine code.  
3. **Concurrency** – the type system enforces thread safety through `Send` and `Sync` traits.
