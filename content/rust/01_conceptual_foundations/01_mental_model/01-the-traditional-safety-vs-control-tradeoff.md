## The Traditional Safety vs Control Tradeoff

What fundamental tradeoff have programming languages historically faced between high-level and low-level languages?

---

Safety vs Control. High-level languages (Python, Java) provide safety through garbage collection but sacrifice performance and control. Low-level languages (C, C++) offer speed and control but require manual memory management, leading to memory bugs.
