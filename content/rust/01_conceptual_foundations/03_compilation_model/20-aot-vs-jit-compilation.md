## AOT vs JIT Compilation

What is the difference between Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation?

AOT (Rust, C++): compiled before running, produces native binaries, fast startup, no runtime. JIT (Java, JavaScript): compiled during execution, requires runtime/VM, can optimize at runtime, has startup overhead.
