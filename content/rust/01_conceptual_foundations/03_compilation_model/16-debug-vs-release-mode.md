## Debug vs Release Mode

What are the differences between debug and release compilation modes?

---

Debug: faster compilation, no optimizations, debug symbols, runtime checks enabled (good for development). Release: slower compilation, aggressive optimizations, no debug symbols, some checks disabled (good for production).
