## Ownership Concept

What is ownership in Rust, and why is it important?

---

Ownership is Rust’s system for managing memory without garbage collection.  
It is enforced at compile time, ensuring memory safety and preventing leaks.  
Analogy: like having the only key to a house—if you give it away, you lose access.
