## Stack Vs Heap

What is the difference between stack and heap memory in Rust?

---

- **Stack**: Stores fixed-size values, very fast push/pop (LIFO).  
- **Heap**: Stores dynamically sized data, requires allocation and pointers.  
Ownership ensures heap data is cleaned up safely and prevents leaks.
