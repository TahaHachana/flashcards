## Why Learn Explicit Before Elision

Why is it important to learn explicit lifetimes before learning elision?

---

Learning explicit lifetimes first prevents elision from seeming like "magic" and helps you:
1. Understand what the compiler is doing automatically
2. Debug edge cases where elision doesn't apply
3. Read old Rust code with verbose annotations
4. Recognize when explicit annotations are needed
5. Make the learning progression: explicit → elision → recognize when to use each
