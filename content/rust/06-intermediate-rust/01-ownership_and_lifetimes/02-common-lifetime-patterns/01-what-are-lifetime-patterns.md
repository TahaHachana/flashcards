## What Are Lifetime Patterns?

What are lifetime patterns in Rust, and why are they important for learning?

---

Lifetime patterns are recurring ways that lifetimes appear in real Rust code. They help you: (1) recognize common scenarios quickly, (2) write correct lifetime annotations naturally, (3) understand library code at a glance, and (4) diagnose lifetime errors faster. Instead of reasoning from first principles every time, you can pattern-match against common cases.
