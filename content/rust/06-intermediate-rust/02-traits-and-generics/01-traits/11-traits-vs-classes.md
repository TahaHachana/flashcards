## Traits vs Classes

How do Rust traits differ from classes in object-oriented languages?

---

Traits are NOT classes. Key differences:

1. Traits don't store data (no fields)
2. Traits only define behavior (methods)
3. A type can implement multiple traits (no single inheritance limit)
4. Traits are implemented separately from type definition
5. Traits provide compile-time polymorphism, not runtime inheritance

Traits define capabilities, not identity.
