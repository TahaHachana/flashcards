## Why Traits Exist - Four Reasons

What are four key problems that traits solve in Rust?

---

1. **Polymorphism without inheritance** - Different types can be used interchangeably when they share behavior
2. **Compile-time guarantees** - Compiler ensures types provide required methods
3. **Zero-cost abstractions** - Static dispatch means no runtime overhead
4. **Code reuse** - Write functions that work with any type implementing a trait
