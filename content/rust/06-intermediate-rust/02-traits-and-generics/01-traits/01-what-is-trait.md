## What Is a Trait in Rust?

What is a trait in Rust, and what is its primary purpose?

---

A trait is Rust's way of defining shared behavior across different types. It's a contract that specifies what methods a type must have. Traits define what a type can *do* (behavior), not what it *is* (data structure). Any type that implements a trait is guaranteed to have the trait's methods.
