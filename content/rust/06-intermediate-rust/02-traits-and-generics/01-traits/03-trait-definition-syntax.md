## Basic Trait Definition Syntax

Write the basic syntax for defining a trait called `Printable` with one required method `print` that takes `&self` and returns nothing.

---

```rust
trait Printable {
    fn print(&self);
}
```

The trait keyword is followed by the trait name, then method signatures in curly braces.
