## Implementation Contract

What three promises do you make when implementing a trait?

---

1. **Provide all required methods** - Every method without a default implementation must be implemented
2. **Match exact signatures** - Parameters and return types must be identical to the trait definition
3. **Enable trait behaviors** - Your type now guarantees it can perform the trait's behaviors

This is a contract between you and the compiler.
