## What Is Trait Implementation?

What does it mean to implement a trait for a type?

---

Implementing a trait means giving a type the ability to use the trait's methods. When you write `impl TraitName for TypeName`, you're telling the compiler: "This type now has these capabilities."

It's like certification - once a type implements a trait, it guarantees it can perform those behaviors.
