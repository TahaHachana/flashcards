## Methods Vs Free Functions

What is the difference between methods and free functions in Rust?

---

* **Methods** are defined in `impl` blocks and tied to a type, improving API organization.
* **Free functions** are not tied to a type and are better when the functionality doesnâ€™t belong to a specific type.
