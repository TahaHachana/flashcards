## Structs Summary

Summarize the key concepts about structs in Rust.

---

* Group related data with semantic clarity.
* Variants: named-field, tuple, unit-like structs.
* Field init shorthand and update syntax ease construction.
* Borrowing avoids ownership transfer.
* Derivable traits: `Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq`, etc.
* Methods and associated functions organize functionality.
* Fields follow ownership rules and are stored together in memory.
