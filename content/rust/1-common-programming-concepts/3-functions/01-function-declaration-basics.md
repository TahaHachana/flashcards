## Function Declaration Basics

How do you declare a function in Rust, and what naming convention is used?

---

Use the `fn` keyword followed by the function name in snake_case, parentheses for parameters, and curly braces for the body.

Example:
```rust
fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```
