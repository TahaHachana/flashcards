## Key Function Rules

Summarize the key rules about functions in Rust.

---

* Declared with `fn`, use snake_case.
* No forward declarations needed.
* Parameter types must be explicit.
* Ownership rules apply to parameters.
* Statements donâ€™t return values; expressions do.
* The last expression (no semicolon) is returned implicitly.
* `return` can be used explicitly.
* Functions without a return type return `()`.
