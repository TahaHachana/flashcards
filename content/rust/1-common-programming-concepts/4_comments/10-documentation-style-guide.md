## Documentation Style Guide

What are the key rules of a good Rust documentation style guide?

---

* Start with a **one-line summary** (imperative mood).
* Add sections only if relevant.
* Include at least one runnable example.
* Use intra-doc links.
* Keep lines under ~100 chars.

Verbose style: public crates, unsafe code.
Minimalist style: trivial helpers, internal code.
