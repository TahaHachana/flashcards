## Integer Types

List Rust's built-in signed and unsigned integer types with their sizes.

---

Signed: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize`

Unsigned: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize`

* `i32` is the default integer type.
* `isize`/`usize` depend on the system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
