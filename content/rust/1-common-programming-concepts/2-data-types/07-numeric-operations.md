## Numeric Operations

What basic arithmetic operations can be performed on numbers in Rust?

---

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (with truncation), and remainder.

```rust
let sum = 5 + 10;
let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;
let product = 4 * 30;
let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
let truncated = -5 / 3; // -1
let remainder = 43 % 5;
```
