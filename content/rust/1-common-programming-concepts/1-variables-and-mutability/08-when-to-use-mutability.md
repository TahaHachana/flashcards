## When To Use Mutability

When should you use `mut` instead of shadowing?

---

Use `mut` when you need to update a variable's value **in place** without changing its type, and when the intent to modify is clear to readers.

Example of intent clarity:

```rust
let mut counter = 0; 
counter += 1; // âœ… clear intent to increment
```

Shadowing is better for transformations or type changes while keeping the name.
