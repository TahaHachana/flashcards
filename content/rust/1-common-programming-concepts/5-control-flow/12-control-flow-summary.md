## Control Flow Summary

Summarize the key control flow constructs in Rust.

---

* `if` requires a `bool` and is an expression.
* `else if` allows multiple conditions; use `match` for many cases.
* `loop` runs until `break`, can return values, supports `continue` and labels.
* `while` runs while a condition is true.
* `for` iterates over collections or ranges; `..` is exclusive, `..=` is inclusive.
* `(range).rev()` iterates backwards.
