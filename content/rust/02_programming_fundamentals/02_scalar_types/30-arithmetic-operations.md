## Arithmetic Operations

What basic arithmetic operations do numeric types support?

---

Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and remainder (%).

```rust
let sum = 5 + 10;
let difference = 95 - 4;
let product = 4 * 30;
let quotient = 56 / 32;
let remainder = 43 % 5;
```
