## Keep Comments Updated

Why are outdated comments problematic?

---

Outdated comments are worse than no comments - they mislead developers. Always update comments when code changes.

```rust
// BAD: Comment doesn't match code
// Add 10 to the total
total += 5;  // Code changed, comment didn't
```
