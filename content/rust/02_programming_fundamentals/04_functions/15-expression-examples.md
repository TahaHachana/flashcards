## Expression Examples

What are some examples of expressions in Rust?

---

Math operations (5 + 6), function calls (add(3, 4)), blocks ({ y + 1 }), if expressions, and match expressions all evaluate to values.

```rust
let x = {
    let y = 3;
    y + 1  // Expression: block evaluates to 4
};
```
