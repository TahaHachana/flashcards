## Three Ownership Rules

What are the three fundamental ownership rules in Rust?

---

1. Each value has one owner (exactly one variable owns each piece of data)
2. Ownership can be transferred (move from one variable to another)
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped (automatic cleanup)
