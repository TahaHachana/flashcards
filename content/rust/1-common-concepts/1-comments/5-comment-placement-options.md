# Comment Placement Options

What are the two main placement options for comments in Rust?

---

1. **Above the code** (preferred for clarity):

```rust
// I'm feeling lucky today
let lucky_number = 7;
```

2. **Inline at the end of a line**:

```rust
let lucky_number = 7; // I'm feeling lucky today
```
