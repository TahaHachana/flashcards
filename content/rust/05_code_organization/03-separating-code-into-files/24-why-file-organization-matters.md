## Why File Organization Matters

Why is proper file organization important in Rust projects?

---

**Reasons file organization matters**:

1. **Maintainability**:
- Smaller files are easier to understand and edit
- Changes are localized to specific files
- Less scrolling to find code

2. **Collaboration**:
- Multiple developers can work on different files
- Fewer merge conflicts
- Clear ownership of modules

3. **Navigation**:
- Easy to find where code lives
- File paths mirror module paths
- IDE navigation works better

4. **Mental model**:
- File structure reinforces module organization
- Easier to understand project architecture
- New team members onboard faster

5. **Compilation** (minor):
- Incremental compilation works better with smaller files
- Only recompile changed modules

**Best practice**: Organize early, even if project is smallâ€”easier to maintain good structure than refactor later.
