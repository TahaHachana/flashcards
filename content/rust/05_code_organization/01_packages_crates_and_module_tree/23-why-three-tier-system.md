## Why the Three-Tier System Exists

Why does Rust use a three-tier system (packages, crates, modules) instead of a simpler approach?

---

The three-tier system provides both flexibility and structure:

**Package level:**
- Distribution and sharing
- Dependency management
- Build configuration

**Crate level:**
- Compilation boundaries (efficiency)
- Namespace isolation
- Reusability unit

**Module level:**
- Internal organization
- Visibility control
- Logical grouping

**Benefit:** Projects can scale from tiny scripts to massive codebases with clear boundaries at each levelâ€”organize freely within crates, compile at crate boundaries, distribute as packages.
