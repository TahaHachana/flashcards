## Why Cargo Matters

What problems does Cargo solve, and why is it central to Rust's ecosystem?

---

**Before Cargo:** Manual compilation with `rustc main.rs` was tedious and error-prone.

**Cargo provides:**
- Dependency management (automatic download and versioning)
- Build automation (`cargo build`, `cargo run`)
- Testing infrastructure (`cargo test`)
- Documentation generation (`cargo doc`)
- Standard project structure
- Package publishing and distribution

**Impact:** Cargo is one of the main reasons for Rust's popularityâ€”it makes project management seamless.
