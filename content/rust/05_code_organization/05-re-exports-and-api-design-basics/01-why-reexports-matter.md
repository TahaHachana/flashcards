## Why Re-exports Matter

What problem do re-exports solve, and how do they improve API design?

---

**Problem**: Internal code organization often doesn't match ideal user experience.

**Without re-exports** (painful):
```rust
use my_crate::internal::database::connection::Connection;
use my_crate::internal::models::user::types::User;
// Users must understand internal structure
```

**With re-exports** (clean):
```rust
use my_crate::{Connection, User};
// Simple, logical API
```

**Benefits**:
- **User experience**: Simple, intuitive imports
- **Implementation hiding**: Internal details stay private
- **Backward compatibility**: Change internals without breaking users
- **Logical grouping**: Present items by function, not implementation

**Key insight**: Re-exports let you optimize internal organization for maintainability and public API for usability.
