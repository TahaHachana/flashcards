## Why Concurrency Exists

What are the four main reasons concurrency exists in programming?

---

Concurrency exists for: (1) Performance - utilizing multiple CPU cores to do more work in less time, (2) Responsiveness - keeping applications responsive while doing background work (like UI threads), (3) Natural modeling - some problems are inherently concurrent (like web servers handling multiple requests), and (4) I/O efficiency - doing useful work while waiting for slow operations like disk or network access.
