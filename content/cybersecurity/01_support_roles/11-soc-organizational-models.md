## SOC Organizational Models

What are the three organizational models for a Security Operations Center?

---

1. **Entirely in-house team** - All SOC personnel are employees of the organization
2. **Fully outsourced** - SOC services provided entirely by external providers
3. **Hybrid model** - Mix of in-house and outsourced resources

The structure depends on the organization's specific needs, but all models provide the same basic service: 24/7 coordinated monitoring.
