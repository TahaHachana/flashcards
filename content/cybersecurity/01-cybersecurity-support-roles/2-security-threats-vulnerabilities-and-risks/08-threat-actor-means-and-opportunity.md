## Threat Actor Means and Opportunity

What determines a threat actor’s means and opportunity?

---

* **Means:** Technical ability—can they write exploits or use pre-made tools?
* **Opportunity:** Access level—are they **internal** (insiders) or **external** (outsiders)?
  Both factors influence how and where attacks occur.
