## Examples of Vulnerabilities

What are common sources of vulnerabilities in IT systems?

---

Vulnerabilities can arise from:

* **Software flaws** (e.g., unpatched systems, misconfigurations)
* **User errors** (e.g., weak passwords, accidental data exposure)
  Attackers often chain multiple vulnerabilities together for deeper system compromise.
