## NIST Cybersecurity Framework Core Functions

What are the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)?

---

The NIST CSF defines five key functions that structure cybersecurity operations:

1. **Identify** – Understand assets and risks.
2. **Protect** – Implement safeguards.
3. **Detect** – Recognize security events.
4. **Respond** – Contain and mitigate incidents.
5. **Recover** – Restore services and resilience.
   These functions create a continuous cycle of protection and improvement.
