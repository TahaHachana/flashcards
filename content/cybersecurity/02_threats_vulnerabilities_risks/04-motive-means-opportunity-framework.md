## Motive Means Opportunity Framework

What three factors from criminal investigation are used to analyze threat actors in cybersecurity?

---

1. **Motive** - Why the threat actor would attack
2. **Means** - How the threat actor can carry out the attack (capabilities and resources)
3. **Opportunity** - When and where the threat actor can exploit vulnerabilities

This framework, borrowed from crime investigation, helps cybersecurity professionals understand and predict potential attacks.
