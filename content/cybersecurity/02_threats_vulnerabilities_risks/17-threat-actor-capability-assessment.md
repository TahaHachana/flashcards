## Threat Actor Capability Assessment

What questions should be asked when assessing a threat actor's means or capability?

---

- Does the threat actor have the capability, or means, to perform a skilled attack?
- Can the threat actor write code to develop new attacks?
- Are they limited to using tools they can download on the Internet?

Understanding the threat actor's technical capabilities helps determine the sophistication of the attack and potential defensive measures needed.
