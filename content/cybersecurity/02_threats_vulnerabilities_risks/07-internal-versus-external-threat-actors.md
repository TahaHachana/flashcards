## Internal Versus External Threat Actors

What is the main distinction between internal and external threat actors?

**Internal Threat Actors:**
- Have some sort of legitimate access already
- Examples: Disgruntled employee or contractor
- Already inside the organization's perimeter

**External Threat Actors:**
- Can only access what's public within an organization
- Must find ways to breach the perimeter
- No legitimate access credentials
