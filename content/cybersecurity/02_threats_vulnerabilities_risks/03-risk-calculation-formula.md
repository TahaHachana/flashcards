## Risk Calculation Formula

How is cybersecurity risk calculated and what determines whether risk is low or high?

---

**Risk Formula:** Risk = Impact Ã— Likelihood

**Components:**
- **Impact:** The loss to the organization, or how much it would hurt
- **Likelihood:** The probability of the incident occurring

**Low Risk:** Incident is not very likely to happen AND damage would be minimal

**High Risk:** Incident will probably happen at some point AND effects would be catastrophic
