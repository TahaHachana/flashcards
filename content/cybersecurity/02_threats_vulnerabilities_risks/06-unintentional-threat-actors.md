## Unintentional Threat Actors

Can threat actors be unintentional? Provide an example.

---

Yes, a threat actor is not always intentional with their attack. Accidental or inadvertent threats may happen.

**Example:** A person who left a company phone or laptop in a taxi is considered a threat actor. While unintentional, it can potentially expose confidential information and is considered a legitimate threat.
