# Home Row Finger Placement (AZERTY)

What are the home row key assignments for each finger on a standard French AZERTY keyboard (include thumbs)?

---

Home row (middle alphabetic row) is: Q S D F G H J K L M  
Left hand: Pinky Q, Ring S, Middle D, Index F (also reaches G).  
Right hand: Index J (also reaches H), Middle K, Ring L, Pinky M.  
Both thumbs rest lightly on the spacebar.  
Note: Top row begins A Z E R T Y… (unlike QWERTY), but touch typing still anchors on the Q–M row.
