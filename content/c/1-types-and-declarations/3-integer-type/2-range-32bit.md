# What is the range of values for a standard int on a 32-bit system?

---

The range of values for a standard `int` on a 32-bit system is from -2147483648 to 2147483647. This is because a 32-bit `int` uses 32 bits to represent signed integers, which allows it to store values in the range of -2^31 to 2^31-1. The maximum value is one less than the minimum value because 0 is included in the range of positive values.
