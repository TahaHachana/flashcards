## Disk Transfer vs Network Transfer

What is the difference between disk transfer and network transfer, including their measurement units?

---

**Disk Transfer**:
- Moving data between memory and storage (disk)
- Direction: Memory â†” Disk
- Measured in: MB/s (megabytes per second) or GB/s (gigabytes per second)
- Example: Saving a video from memory to disk

**Network Transfer**:
- Moving data across a network to another device
- Measured in: Mb/s (megabits per second) or Gb/s (gigabits per second)
- Uses **bits** (not bytes) - eight times smaller
- Example: Sending a video to a friend over the internet

**Critical Difference**: Network uses bits (b), disk uses bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits.
