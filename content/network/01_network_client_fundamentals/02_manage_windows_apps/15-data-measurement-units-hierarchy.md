## Data Measurement Units Hierarchy

Define a gigabyte and explain the data measurement hierarchy from bits to gigabytes.

---

**Gigabyte (GB)**: A measure of storage capacity roughly equal to 1,000,000,000 (one billion) bytes.

**Hierarchy**:
- 1 bit = single binary digit (0 or 1)
- 1 byte = 8 bits
- 1 Kilobyte (KB) = 1,000 bytes (approximately)
- 1 Megabyte (MB) = 1,000,000 bytes (1 million)
- 1 Gigabyte (GB) = 1,000,000,000 bytes (1 billion)

**Example**: 32 GB of memory = 32 billion bytes of temporary information storage while computer is powered on.
