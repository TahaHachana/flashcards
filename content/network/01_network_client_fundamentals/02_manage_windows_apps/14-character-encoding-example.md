## Character Encoding Example

How is the text "CompTIA A+" stored in computer memory?

---

```
01000011 (C)
01101111 (o)
01101101 (m)
01110000 (p)
01010100 (T)
01001001 (I)
01000001 (A)
00100000 (space)
01000001 (A)
00101011 (+)
```

This demonstrates that even brief text requires substantial sequences of 1s and 0s. The correspondence between computer-readable format (1s and 0s) and human-readable format was established in the mid-20th century and exists in all modern computers.
