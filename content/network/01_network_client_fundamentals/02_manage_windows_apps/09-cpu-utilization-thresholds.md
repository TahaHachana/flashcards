## CPU Utilization Thresholds

What CPU utilization percentage indicates a potential problem, and what are three possible causes of consistently high CPU usage?

---

**Problem Threshold**: Utilization consistently at 70-80% or higher indicates an issue.

**Three Possible Causes**:
1. **Underpowered CPU**: Processor insufficient for workload demands; hardware upgrade may be needed
2. **Problematic Application**: Specific application consuming excessive resources, possibly due to bugs or inefficient code
3. **Malware Infection**: Malicious software running in background consuming resources

**Normal Usage**: Occasional spikes are normal (like when launching applications), but consistent high utilization requires investigation.
