## Memory Performance Characteristics

What are the key characteristics of system memory (RAM) that affect performance?

---

**Memory Classification**:
- **Volatile (Non-Persistent)**: Only works when device is powered on; data lost when system shuts down

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Speed**: Expressed in megahertz (MHz); indicates how quickly memory can operate
- **Capacity**: Measured in gigabytes (GB); determines how many applications can run simultaneously

**Example**: 1 GB â‰ˆ 30 minutes of standard definition video stored temporarily in memory for immediate retrieval
