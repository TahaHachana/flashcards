## Four Major Computer Subsystems

What are the four major subsystems of a computer that should be monitored for performance?

---

1. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The processor that executes instructions and performs calculations
2. **Memory (RAM)**: Random Access Memory for active processes and temporary storage
3. **Storage**: Disk drives for persistent data and file storage
4. **Networking**: Network connectivity and communication (covered in later lessons)

IT professionals should stay on top of hardware, software, and apps by monitoring these subsystems to ensure computers perform well for users and maintain security.
