## Disk Performance Monitoring Focus

What does the Task Manager Performance tab show for disk monitoring, and what does it NOT show?

---

**DOES Show**:
- Read-write performance
- Average response time (how quickly disk responds to requests)
- Active transfer rates
- Real-time disk activity over 60-second period

**Does NOT Show**:
- How full the disk is
- Total capacity utilization
- Available free space

**Purpose**: Monitor how disks perform (speed and responsiveness), not capacity. Use File Explorer or Disk Management for capacity information.
