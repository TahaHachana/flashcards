## Zero-Based Counting in Computers

What is zero-based counting and how does it differ from human counting?

---

**Zero-Based Counting**: Computers start counting at 0, not 1.

**Comparison**:
- **Humans typically count**: 1, 2, 3, 4...
- **Computers count**: 0, 1, 2, 3...

**Example in Disk Naming**:
- **Disk 0** = First disk in the system
- **Disk 1** = Second disk in the system
- Pattern continues: 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.

This is why the first item is numbered 0 rather than 1 in computer systems.
