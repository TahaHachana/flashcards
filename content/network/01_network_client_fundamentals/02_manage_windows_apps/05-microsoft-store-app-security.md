## Microsoft Store App Security

How do Microsoft Store apps differ from desktop apps in terms of security and permissions?

---

**Microsoft Store Apps**:
- Microsoft Store performs vetting to remove unsafe apps
- Have **limited permissions**
- Generally do **not run as admin**
- Have **restricted access to the system**
- More secure by default

**Desktop Apps**:
- May prompt for admin access to make changes to computer
- This poses a risk to your system
- Greater system access and privileges

**Limitations of Microsoft Store**:
- Developers must pay registration fee, so many apps may not be available
- Store apps might have different versions than desktop apps with varying features
