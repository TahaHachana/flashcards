## 32-bit vs 64-bit Processors

What is the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit processors in terms of memory access and current usage?

---

**32-bit Processors**:
- Can access only about 4 GB of physical memory
- Older technology
- Not widely used anymore

**64-bit Processors**:
- Can access much more physical memory than 32-bit
- Modern standard
- Most computers built in the last few years use 64-bit processors

The bit designation indicates how much memory the processor can access, with 64-bit providing significantly greater memory addressing capability.
