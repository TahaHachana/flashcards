## Applications vs Services

What is the difference between applications and services in Windows?

---

**Applications**:
- User launches and interacts with them
- Have a GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- Examples: Web browser, photo application
- Visible in Task Manager Applications tab

**Services**:
- Run in the background
- User typically doesn't interact directly with them
- Provide functionality taken for granted
- Often have "arcane" or technical names
- Examples: Bluetooth service, network services, computer sound
- Visible in Task Manager Services tab

**Key Distinction**: Applications are user-facing with interfaces; services run automatically in the background without user interaction.
