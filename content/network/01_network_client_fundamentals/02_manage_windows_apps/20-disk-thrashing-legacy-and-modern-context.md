## Disk Thrashing Legacy and Modern Context

What is disk thrashing and how does this concept apply to modern SSDs?

---

**Historical Context (HDDs)**:
- "Thrashing" = disk working too hard with constant activity
- Physical disk heads moving excessively
- Mechanical wear and performance issues

**Modern Context (SSDs)**:
- SSDs don't physically "thrash" because they have no moving parts
- **However, SSDs can still have performance problems**:
  - Reduced read-write speeds
  - Increased average response time
  - Performance degradation

**Common Cause**: Running out of usable disk space can lead to these performance issues in both HDDs and SSDs.
