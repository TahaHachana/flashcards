## Warning Signs of Disk Performance Problems

What are three warning signs of disk performance problems visible in Task Manager?

---

1. **Declining Speed**: Read-write speeds decrease over time; slower than expected transfer rates

2. **Excessive Spikes**: Lots of read-write activity with multiple high spikes during the 60-second monitoring period; sustained high activity levels

3. **Poor Response Time**: Average response time increases; delayed reaction to file access requests; applications slow to open

**Interpretation**: These signs may indicate the disk is running out of usable space or experiencing hardware problems. Some spikes are normal (like during application launches), but sustained high activity requires investigation.
