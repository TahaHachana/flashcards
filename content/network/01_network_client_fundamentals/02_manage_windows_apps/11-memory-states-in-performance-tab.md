## Memory States in Performance Tab

What are the four memory usage categories displayed in Task Manager's Performance tab?

---

1. **In Use (Compressed)**: Memory actively allocated to running applications; may include compressed data (e.g., 16.4 GB of 32 GB being used)

2. **Available**: Free memory ready for new applications (e.g., 15 GB available)

3. **Modified**: Memory with content that must be written to disk before it can be reused

4. **Standby**: Memory containing cached data not currently in active use; can be repurposed if more memory is required

These categories help determine if you need to add more RAM or optimize running applications.
