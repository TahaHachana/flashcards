## User Profile Permissions and Access

When a new user profile is created in Windows, what happens automatically and who can access the created files?

---

When a user profile is created, Windows automatically generates:
- Associated folders and files
- User-specific directories
- Personalized settings storage

Only two parties can access these files:
1. The account owner (the user themselves)
2. The system administrator or domain administrator (if computer is domain-joined)
