## Security Notifications for Unusual Sign-In Activity

What three types of unusual sign-in attempts trigger security notifications in Windows?

---

Windows notifies account owners when sign-in attempts are made from:

1. **New Network**: Different IP address or network location
2. **Unfamiliar Device**: New computer or mobile device not previously used
3. **Unfamiliar Geographic Location**: Different city, state, or country

**Purpose**:
- Alert legitimate users to potential unauthorized access
- Enable quick response to security threats
- Provide visibility into account access patterns
