## Defense in Depth Authentication Strategy

What is a defense in depth approach to authentication and why is it effective?

---

**Defense in Depth**: Combining multiple layers of security rather than relying on a single method.

**Application to Authentication**:
Combine strong passwords with multifactor authentication (MFA):
- First layer: Strong, unique password (something you know)
- Second layer: Additional factor like biometric or token (something you are/have)
- Third layer: Security notifications for unusual activity

**Effectiveness**:
Creates multiple barriers to unauthorized access. If one layer is compromised (e.g., password stolen), the additional layers still protect the account. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access compared to password-only authentication.
