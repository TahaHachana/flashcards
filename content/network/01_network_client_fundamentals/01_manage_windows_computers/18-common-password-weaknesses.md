## Common Password Weaknesses

Why do passwords offer relatively weak security as an authentication method?

---

Passwords have several inherent weaknesses:

1. **Users create weak passwords**: Easily guessed or simple combinations
2. **Password reuse**: Same password used across multiple devices and accounts
3. **Written down**: Users write passwords and post them near devices
4. **Predictable patterns**: Users follow common patterns that are easily cracked

These human factors make password-only authentication vulnerable, which is why multifactor authentication is recommended to add additional security layers.
