## Principle of Least Privilege for Permissions

What is the principle of least privilege and how should it be applied to file and folder permissions?

---

**Principle**: Assign the minimum necessary permissions required for users to perform their job functions.

**Application to Permissions**:
- Give users only the permission level they need
- Don't grant Full Control unless absolutely necessary
- Restrict Full Control to administrators and owners only
- Regularly review user permissions
- Use appropriate permission levels based on user roles and responsibilities

This minimizes security risks by limiting potential damage from compromised accounts or user errors.
