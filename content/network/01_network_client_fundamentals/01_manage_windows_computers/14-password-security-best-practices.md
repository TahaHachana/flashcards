## Password Security Best Practices

What are six things to avoid when creating and managing passwords according to industry best practices?

---

1. **Avoid sharing passwords**: Each user should have unique credentials
2. **Avoid reusing passwords**: Use different passwords for different accounts
3. **Avoid incrementing passwords**: Don't use "password1", "password2", etc.
4. **Avoid personal information**: No birthdates, pets' names, or easily guessed details
5. **Avoid dictionary words**: Single dictionary words are easily cracked
6. **Avoid common patterns**: No "1234", "xoxo", "abc123", or keyboard patterns

These practices prevent passwords from being easily guessed or cracked.
