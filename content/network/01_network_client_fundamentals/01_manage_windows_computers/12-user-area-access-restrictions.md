## User Area Access Restrictions

What are the standard folders in a Windows user area and what access restrictions apply?

---

**Standard Folders** (common to all users):
- Downloads folder
- Documents folder
- Other standard Windows user folders

**Access Restrictions**:
- Users can only see their own files and folders
- Cannot access other users' personal files
- System area is restricted to authorized users (administrators only)

This separation ensures privacy and security by isolating each user's data.
