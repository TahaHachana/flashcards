## Two-Factor Authentication Process

How does two-factor authentication (2FA) work and what delivery methods can be used for the second factor?

---

**Process**:
1. User enters password (something you know)
2. System generates a unique, time-sensitive code
3. Code is sent to user via chosen delivery method
4. User enters code to confirm sign-in
5. Access granted only after both factors verified

**Delivery Methods for Second Factor**:
- Text message (SMS)
- Phone call
- Email
- Authenticator app

This provides an additional layer of security beyond passwords alone.
