## Windows Command-Line Interfaces

What are the two main command-line interfaces in Windows and how do they differ?

1. **Command Prompt (CMD)**:
   - Traditional/legacy interface
   - Limited command set
   - Basic functionality for simple tasks

2. **Windows PowerShell**:
   - Modern, more powerful interface
   - Supports both Unix-style (ls) and Windows-style (dir) commands
   - Available in standard and administrator versions
   - Includes command-line completion with Tab key
   - Supports piping commands (e.g., ls | more)
