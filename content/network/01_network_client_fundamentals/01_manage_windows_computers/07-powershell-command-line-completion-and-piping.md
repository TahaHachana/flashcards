## PowerShell Command-Line Completion and Piping

How does command-line completion work in PowerShell and what is an example of using piping for better output readability?

---

**Command-Line Completion**:
- Start typing a directory/file name
- Press Tab key to auto-complete
- Saves time and reduces typing errors

**Piping Example**:
`ls | more`
- The pipe operator (|) is above the backslash key
- Lists directory contents one page at a time
- Press Enter to scroll line-by-line
- Press Ctrl+C to exit
- More coherent than scrolling output
