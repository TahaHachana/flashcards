## Authentication vs Authorization

What is the difference between authentication and authorization in access control?

---

**Authentication**:
- The process of proving identity
- Verifies "who you are"
- Determines if user is authorized to access the system at all
- Happens first in the access control process

**Authorization**:
- The process of granting specific privileges and permissions
- Determines "what you can do"
- Controls access to storage areas and resources after authentication
- Defines scope of user capabilities within the system

**Relationship**: Authentication establishes identity, then authorization determines what that identity can access.
