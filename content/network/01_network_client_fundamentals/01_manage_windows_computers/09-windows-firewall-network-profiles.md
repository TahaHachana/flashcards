## Windows Firewall Network Profiles

What are the three Windows Firewall network profile types and when should each be used?

---

1. **Domain Network**:
   - Applied when connected to a Windows domain
   - Corporate/organizational network settings
   - Managed by domain policies

2. **Private Network**:
   - Used for trusted networks (e.g., home network)
   - More relaxed security settings
   - Suitable for known, secure environments

3. **Public Network**:
   - Applied when connected to public Wi-Fi or untrusted networks
   - Strictest security settings recommended
   - Enhanced protection when "out and about"

Best practice: Configure stricter settings for public networks versus home networks.
