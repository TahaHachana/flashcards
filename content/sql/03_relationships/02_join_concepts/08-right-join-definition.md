## RIGHT JOIN Definition

What is a RIGHT JOIN and why is it less commonly used than LEFT JOIN?

---

A RIGHT JOIN returns ALL rows from the right (second) table plus matching rows from the left (first) table. It's less common because it's logically equivalent to a LEFT JOIN with the tables swapped - most developers prefer to rewrite queries using LEFT JOIN for consistency and readability.
