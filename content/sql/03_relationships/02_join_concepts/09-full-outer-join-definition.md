## FULL OUTER JOIN Definition

What is a FULL OUTER JOIN and what rows does it return?

---

A FULL OUTER JOIN returns ALL rows from BOTH tables. When there's a match, rows are combined. When there's no match, the row from one table appears with NULLs for the other table's columns. This means rows with matches appear once (combined), and rows without matches appear with NULLs on the side that didn't match.
