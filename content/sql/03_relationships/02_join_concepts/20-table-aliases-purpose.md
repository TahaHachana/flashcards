## Table Aliases Purpose

Why are table aliases important when writing JOINs, and when are they absolutely required?

---

Table aliases make queries shorter and more readable by providing abbreviated names for tables. They are REQUIRED in two situations: (1) self-joins, where you need to distinguish between different instances of the same table, and (2) when referencing ambiguous column names that exist in multiple joined tables.
