## INNER JOIN Definition

What is an INNER JOIN and what rows does it return?

---

An INNER JOIN returns only the rows where there is a match in BOTH tables based on the JOIN condition. If a row in either table has no matching row in the other table, it is excluded from the results. This is the most restrictive type of JOIN.
