## Self JOIN Concept

What is a self-join and what does it allow you to do?

---

A self-join is when a table is joined to itself. It allows you to compare rows within the same table or traverse hierarchical relationships. The table must be given different aliases to distinguish between the "left" and "right" instances in the JOIN.
