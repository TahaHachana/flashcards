## FULL OUTER JOIN Use Cases

What is a common use case for FULL OUTER JOIN and why is it relatively rare?

---

A common use case is finding all mismatches - identifying rows that exist in either table but not both (such as customers with no orders AND orders with no valid customer). It's rare because most business questions focus on matched data or preserving just one side of the relationship, not both.
