## What Is a JOIN Operation

What does a JOIN operation do in SQL, and what is the fundamental mathematical concept behind it?

---

A JOIN combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. The fundamental mathematical concept is the Cartesian product - JOINs start by conceptually creating all possible combinations of rows from the tables, then filter these combinations based on the JOIN condition to keep only the meaningful matches.
