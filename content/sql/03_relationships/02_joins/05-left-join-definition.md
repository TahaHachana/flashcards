## LEFT JOIN Definition

What is a LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN) and what rows does it return?

---

A LEFT JOIN returns ALL rows from the left (first) table, plus matching rows from the right (second) table. When there's no match in the right table, the result includes the left table row with NULL values for all right table columns. This ensures no rows from the left table are lost.
