## The Cartesian Product Foundation

If Table A has 3 rows and Table B has 4 rows, how many row combinations does the Cartesian product produce, and what does a JOIN condition do to this result?

---

The Cartesian product produces 12 row combinations (3 Ã— 4). The JOIN condition acts as a filter on this Cartesian product, keeping only the combinations where the JOIN condition evaluates to TRUE and discarding the rest.
