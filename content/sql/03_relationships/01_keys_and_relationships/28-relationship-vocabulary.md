## Relationship Vocabulary

What are some alternative terms for describing one-to-many relationships?

---

One-to-many can be described many ways:

Formal:
- One-to-many
- Parent-child
- Master-detail

Informal (often clearer):
- Container-contents (shopping cart → items)
- Owner-owned (customer → orders)
- Category-members (department → employees)
- Collection-elements (playlist → songs)

All describe the same pattern:
- ONE parent/container/owner
- MANY children/contents/owned items

Use whichever terminology makes the relationship clearest in context.

Example: "Shopping cart contains items" is clearer than "Shopping cart has one-to-many relationship with items."
