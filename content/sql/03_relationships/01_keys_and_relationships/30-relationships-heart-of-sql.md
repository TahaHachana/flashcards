## Relationships Are The Heart of SQL

Why are relationships considered "the heart of SQL"? What makes them fundamental to relational databases?

---

Relationships are central because:

1. Enable normalization
   - Split data logically
   - Store facts once
   - Eliminate redundancy

2. Reflect reality
   - Real-world entities are related
   - Databases model these relationships
   - Customers DO place orders, authors DO write books

3. Enable powerful queries
   - JOINs reunite separated data
   - Query across relationships
   - Answer complex questions

4. Maintain data integrity
   - Referential integrity prevents orphans
   - Ensures consistency
   - Protects relationships

Without relationships:
- Just isolated tables
- No connections
- Can't model real world
- Massive redundancy

With relationships:
- Connected data model
- Normalized structure
- Flexible queries
- Data integrity

This is why "relational" database - it's ALL about relationships!
