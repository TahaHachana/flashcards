## One-to-Many Definition

What is a one-to-many relationship? Give three real-world examples.

---

One-to-many: One parent can have many children.

The MOST COMMON relationship pattern in databases.

Examples:
1. One customer → many orders
2. One author → many books
3. One department → many employees
4. One artist → many paintings
5. One category → many products

Key characteristic: The parent (one side) can be referenced by multiple children (many side), but each child belongs to exactly one parent.
