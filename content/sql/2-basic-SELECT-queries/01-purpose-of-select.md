## Purpose of the SELECT Statement

What is the main purpose of the SQL SELECT statement?

---

The SELECT statement retrieves data from one or more tables and returns it as a **result set**, a temporary virtual table.  
It is the foundation of SQL and expresses what data to fetch, not how to fetch it.
