## HAVING Clause Purpose

What does the HAVING clause do, and when in the query process does it operate?

---

HAVING filters groups after they've been created and aggregate values have been calculated. It operates on summarized data, deciding which groups to include in the result set. It's a post-grouping filter that filters aggregated results. HAVING is evaluated after GROUP BY but before SELECT.
