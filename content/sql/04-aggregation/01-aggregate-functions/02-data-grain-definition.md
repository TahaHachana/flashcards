## Data Grain Definition

What does "grain" mean in the context of SQL data, and how do aggregates affect it?

---

Grain refers to the level of detail in your results. Row-level grain means each result row represents one entity (one customer, one order). Summary-level grain means each result row represents a statistical summary (total sales, average price). Aggregates change the grain from detailed to summarized.
