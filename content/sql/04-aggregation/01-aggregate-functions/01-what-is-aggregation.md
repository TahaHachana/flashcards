## What Is Aggregation?

What is the fundamental difference between a query with aggregation versus a query without aggregation?

---

Without aggregation, queries operate on a row-by-row basis - each row in the result corresponds to a row (or combination of rows) in the source tables. With aggregation, multiple rows are collapsed into a single summary value. Aggregation changes from showing individual data points to showing statistics about the data.
