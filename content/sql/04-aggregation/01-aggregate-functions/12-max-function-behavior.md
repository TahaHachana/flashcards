## MAX Function Behavior

What does MAX() return, and how does it differ from MIN()?

---

MAX() finds the maximum value in a column, working with any comparable type. For numbers it returns the highest value, for dates the latest date, and for strings the alphabetically last value. It ignores NULL values. It's the opposite of MIN() - where MIN finds the smallest/earliest/first, MAX finds the largest/latest/last.
