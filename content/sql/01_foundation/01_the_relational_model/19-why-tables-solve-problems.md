## Why Tables Solve Fundamental Problems

What four fundamental data management problems does the relational model solve?

---

1. Redundancy: Store each fact once, reference when needed
   - Solution: Normalization + foreign keys

2. Inconsistency: Ensure data stays valid across system
   - Solution: Constraints + relationships maintain integrity

3. Complexity: Non-programmers can query data
   - Solution: Declarative SQL (describe what, not how)

4. Maintainability: Change structure without breaking everything
   - Solution: Data independence (logical separate from physical)
