## Academic Citation Analogy for Keys

Using the academic citation analogy, explain how primary and foreign keys work.

---

Like citations in academic papers:

Primary Key = Paper's unique identifier (DOI, ISBN)
- Each paper has one unique identifier
- Used to reference that specific paper

Foreign Key = Citation to another paper
- When paper A references paper B, it uses B's identifier
- You can look up the referenced paper independently
- Papers don't physically contain each other, just references

Same in databases:
- Each row has unique primary key
- Other tables reference it using foreign keys
- Can look up related data independently
- Tables don't duplicate data, just reference it
