## Mathematical Relations Definition

What is a mathematical relation in the context of databases? (Explain using the concept of combinations)

---

A relation is a set of valid combinations of values.

Each row represents ONE specific combination across all columns. For example, in a table with Name, Age, City:
- Row: Alice | 25 | Paris means "There is a person named Alice, who is 25, who lives in Paris"
- The row is not three separate facts, but one fact about a combination

The table (relation) is the set of all valid combinations.
