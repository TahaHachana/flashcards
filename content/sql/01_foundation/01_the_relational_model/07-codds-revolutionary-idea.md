## Codds Revolutionary Idea

What was Dr. E.F. Codd's revolutionary idea in 1970 that changed database design?

---

Use simple tables and redundant data (like customer IDs) to link records instead of physical pointers.

Key innovation: Separation of logical data structure from physical storage.

This made databases:
- Simpler to understand and query
- More maintainable
- Mathematically rigorous
- Declarative (say WHAT you want, not HOW to get it)
