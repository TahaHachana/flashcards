## Tables Rows and Columns Structure

In a relational database table, what do rows represent, what do columns represent, and how do they work together?

---

Columns: Define the attributes (what properties exist)
- Example: Name, Age, City

Rows: Provide instances (specific combinations of values)
- Example: Alice | 25 | Paris

Together: Each row is one valid combination of column values, representing one entity or fact in the system.

The table is the complete set of all valid combinations for that type of entity.
