## Set Theory - No Duplicates Property

In set theory, what is the rule about duplicate elements, and how does this apply to database tables?

---

A set has no duplicates - each element appears exactly once.

In databases:
- A table is a set of rows
- Each row must be distinct (unique)
- This is why we need primary keys to ensure uniqueness
