## Tuple Definition

What is a "tuple" in relational database terminology?

---

A tuple is a row - a specific combination of values for all attributes (columns) in a relation.

Example: In a Person table with columns (Name, Age, City)
- Tuple: (Alice, 25, Paris)

The term comes from mathematics, where an n-tuple is an ordered list of n elements.

In databases: Row = Tuple = Record (though "row" is the preferred SQL term)
