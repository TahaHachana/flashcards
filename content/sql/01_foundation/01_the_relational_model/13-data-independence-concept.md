## Data Independence Concept

What is "data independence" and why is it an advantage of relational databases?

---

Data independence means the logical structure of data is separated from its physical storage.

Advantages:
- Applications don't break when storage changes
- Can optimize physical storage without changing queries
- Can reorganize data without rewriting applications
- Physical implementation details are hidden from users

Example: The database can move tables to faster disks or change indexing without affecting your SQL queries.
