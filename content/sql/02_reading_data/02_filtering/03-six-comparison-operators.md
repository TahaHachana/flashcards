## Six Basic Comparison Operators

What are the six basic comparison operators in SQL? Give examples of each.

---

1. = (Equal to)
   ```sql
   WHERE age = 25
   ```

2. <> (Not equal to, also !=)
   ```sql
   WHERE status <> 'Cancelled'
   ```

3. < (Less than)
   ```sql
   WHERE price < 100
   ```

4. > (Greater than)
   ```sql
   WHERE quantity > 0
   ```

5. <= (Less than or equal)
   ```sql
   WHERE age <= 65
   ```

6. >= (Greater than or equal)
   ```sql
   WHERE score >= 90
   ```

These work on numbers, text (alphabetically), and dates (chronologically).
