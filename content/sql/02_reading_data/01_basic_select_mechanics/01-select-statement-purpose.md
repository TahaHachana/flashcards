## SELECT Statement Purpose

What does the SELECT statement do? What does it NOT mean?

---

SELECT retrieves data from a database. 

It does NOT mean "display" - it means "retrieve/get this data."

What happens to the data depends on the client:
- Database GUI displays it
- Programming language receives it as data structures
- Report generator formats it

Mental model: SELECT asks the database a question, and the database answers with a result set.
