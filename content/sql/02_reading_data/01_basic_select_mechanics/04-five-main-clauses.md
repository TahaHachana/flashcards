## The Five Main Clauses

What are the five main clauses of a SELECT statement, and what does each do?

---

1. SELECT - Specifies which columns to retrieve
2. FROM - Specifies which table to retrieve from
3. WHERE - Filters which rows to include (optional)
4. GROUP BY - Groups rows for aggregation (optional, later phase)
5. ORDER BY - Sorts the results (optional)

Critical: Must be written in this order, even though they execute in different order (FROM → WHERE → SELECT → ORDER BY).
